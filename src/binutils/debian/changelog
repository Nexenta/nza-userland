    enclosed here in order to support System.map

  * The "Let's Get This Party Started Right" upload
    (since I'm closing as many old bugs as possible)
  * Removed sparc patch altogether
  * Added a small alpha patch from upstream to fix
    some obscure PLT/GOT issues.
  * Manpages are now fixed finally -- no more
    I<symbol> (closes: Bug#108369)
  * Have not gotten another report of the
    debconf message being cut off, so I'm closing
    the debconf-related bug.  I suspect this may
    have been a problem in the debconf front-end
    being used, but I have not been able to reproduce
    it (closes: Bug#149045)
  * Closing a bug report that I had tagged moreinfo
    a LONG time ago (over one year), but never got
    more info on.  I have not heard of this kind
    of problem since, nor have I been able to
    reproduce it at any time since (closes: Bug#105986).
    For interested parties, it revolved around
    allowing gcc to show a linker error, but the
    reporter didn't know about the -v option for
    gcc.  There was a linker problem, but it appeared
    to be either hardware failure or user error.
  * Closing a demangler 'bug' that revolved around
    stripping @PLT from symbol names.  Since the
    PLT suffix is documented, I'm going to close
    this bug.  Also, it doesn't help that the symbol
    in the bug report uses an obsolete mangling style,
    so I can't test this even if I wanted to

    support.
  * Upstream: Fix eh_frame.
  * Upstream: Turn on combreloc by default.
  * Upstream: Enable gprof for Linux/mips.
  * Turn combreloc off for ARM explicitly until
    I can confirm that PIC is not still broken
    by using it.
  * Remove IA-64 unwind patch and objcopy fix
    since they are included in the upstream sources
    now.
  * Re-enable testsuite run since Randolph did the NMU
    on dejagnu (thank you!).
  * Appears to fix sparc64 linking problems.  I'm
    still looking into exactly what was going on with
    that (closes: Bug#137850)
  * Enabled hppa64-linux support in main binutils
    package (closes: Bug#137955)

    I apparently misunderstood the instructions

    debconf (closes: Bug#136295)
  * Disable combreloc default on ARM since it

    Please test other ARM bugs against this
    version and inform me of the results!

    (closes: Bug#107812)
  * Include IA64 unwind fix from CVS to fix kernel
    linking on IA64. (closes: Bug#135143)
  * Added French translation of the debconf
    bits.  Thanks to Denis Barbier for the
    work on that. (closes: Bug#134626)
  * Disabled testsuite run until dejagnu is
    fixed.  I'm leaving the build-dep for dejagnu
    in, though, since I know I'll forget to
    reinsert it when I do re-enable the testsuite

  * Keep on disabling efi-app-ia32 type targets
    since the segfault is still unfixed in CVS and
    I haven't had the time to go back and really
    debug and fix this.
  * Updated standards version.
  * Corrected some of the lintian problems (all except
    the ones involving Changelog.linux, the .comment
    section, and the missing manpages for
    binutils-multiarch's binaries since that package
    depends on binutils, which provides those).

binutils (2.11.92.0.12.3-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "Make The Bad Man Stop" upload.
  * Revert patch to bfd/elf32-sparc.c (already
    reverted upstream) that broke UA32 relocs on sparc
    and caused bus errors with C++/Java binaries
    (closes: Bug#126162)
  * Remove i486-mingw32 target from the enabled
    in multiarch and removed efi-app-ia32 from the
    BFD config for Intel linux targets until I can find
    and fixthe segfaults that seem to keep coming up when
    reading Windows files and viruses with objdump or
    strings.  This is only temporary, so I'm not closing
    the bugs until the problem gets fixed, but
    I am going to bump them down to wishlist, merge
    them, and note the above in them.
    (debian/patches/010_disable_efi_app_ia32_TEMPORARY.diff
    disables the efi-app-ia32 BFD in case someone
    wants to revert this change easily)
  * Added debconf warning about the kernel linking
    situation since it keeps coming up and people
    keep initially disagreeing with me about this
    being a kernel bug.  Also, merged prior warning
    about -oformat change into the same debconf warning
    (it's two, two, two warnings in one).  This makes
    the DEBIAN_FRONTEND case bug moot (closes: Bug#131801)
  * Added powerpc64-linux target to multiarch since
    work is progressing on that target and the machines
    are due to hit the shelves Very Soon(TM).

    Besides, multiarch was incredibly large, which
    was probably unneeded.

  * Upstream: Update handling relocations against
    the discarded sections. You may need to apply
    the kernel patch enclosed here to your kernel
    source.
  * Upstream: Support "-march=xxx -mipsN" for mips
    gas if they are compatible.
  * Upstream: Fix a regression when linking with
    non-ELF object files.
  * Includes Alan Modra's patch to reduce stub sizes
    on HPPA.  Should help C++ on HPPA.
  * Once again includes a mips patch from HJ Lu.
  * My documentation changes were cleaned up and
    accepted upstream, so the gas manpage fixes go
    away (hurray!).
  * Stopped iterating targets for binutils-multiarch
    and started enabling all of them.  This saves
    maintenance time since new targets will be
    automatically supported in future uploads
    and existing targets that I didn't include
    before will be supported from now on.  This may
    grow build time and the libbfd in the multiarch
    package, but it's worth it.
  * Also, started using the --enable-64-bit-bfd
    flag for configuring multiarch.  I don't know
    why I didn't realise this wasn't there before
    since I test with it all of the time.

  * Fix the ld texinfo file to not mention the old

  * No mips/ dir patches need to be applied with this one.
    Woohoo!
  * Removed patches from debian/patches that are already
    applied upstream.
  * Patched version strings to reflect that this is a
    Debian release at the request of upstream (to prevent
    confusion, apparently).
  * Applied patch from H.J. Lu to fix mips section
    misalignment.
  * Applied patch from Jakub Jelinek to fix kernel linking
    on i386 and possibly other archs (closes: Bug#116041)
  * Fixed postinst and prerm for binutils-doc to test that
    the files exist before calling install-info.  This should
    fix the odd circumstance when binutils-doc is packaged on
    an arch that doesn't support gprof (or any other dir for
    that matter) and, therefore, the docs that are usually
    made in that dir aren't made.  This is particularly true
    with gprof on mips.

binutils (2.11.92.0.5-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Enable -z combreloc on all targets. This will make
    prelinking possible with the prelink package.  Please
    test this on all archs prior to upload.  If it fails, file
    a bug immediately and I'll disable the patch for that
    platform.
  * Added patches from Alan Modra (from CVS) to fix other
    archs after the refcount patch broke them.  This supercedes
    the powerpc patch, so I replaced that with this.
    (closes: Bug#115218)
  * Added patch from H.J. Lu (from CVS) to fix IA64 linker
    problems as well.
  * Added patch from David Kimdon to specify which filename is
    causing an error if that filename is a dir (closes: Bug#45832).
  * Removed workaround patch for stabs problem on Alpha since
    it appears to be causing problems on mips and is no longer
    needed on Alpha anyway.
  * Now runs the testsuite and includes the results in the
    binutils package for reference.

binutils (2.11.90.0.27-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Remove bash dependency...ash's behaviour has
    already been modified, so it should be able
    to build binutils now (closes: Bug#106992)
  * Includes new S/390 patch (closes: Bug#109300)
  * Could never reproduce objdump segfault and
    never got a reply on the bug report
    (closes: Bug#93884)
  * Can't reproduce m68k segfault either
    (closes: Bug#87714)

binutils (2.11.90.0.27-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream source (synced with 20010810 CVS)
  * Upstream: Fixed x86 linker bug.
  * Reverted a patch to gas to dodge a bug in STABS output
    on Alpha using gcc 2.95.4, so alpha can be in sync
    with the rest of the archs now.
  * Fixes strip problems with busybox (closes: Bug#106593)
  * Kernels should compile ok again on i386
    (closes: Bug#107190)

binutils (2.11.90.0.25-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream source (synced with 20010726 CVS)
  * Upstream: fix i386 assembler bug.
  * Upstream: "make check" has 2 failures in the
    ld-selective test in ld on Linux/alpha. They
    should be marked xfail. Fixed in the next release.
  * Removed m68k patch (closes: Bug#106431)
  * Man pages appear to be correctly generated now
    (closes: Bug#98569, Bug# 98938)
  * Added bash build dependency (closes: Bug#106992)
  * Should compile ok on powerpc (the last one did
    also...don't know why voltaire's build daemon failed).
    I won't close this bug until I build it myself
    on voltaire or hear back from the autobuilder folks
    on PPC.
  * Looking into the whole LD_LIBRARY_PATH issue that
    keeps being brought up.  I think the docs are wrong
    because the templates say that it shouldn't obey that
    at all.  Can we please stop filing duplicate bugs for
    this?  I would greatly appreciate it...

binutils (2.11.90.0.24-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream source (synced with 20010714 CVS)
  * DO NOT COMPILE FOR ALPHA.  I need to fix gcc 2.95.4
    prior to this release working on Alpha correctly
    (long story).
  * Upstream: Avoid COPY relocs on i386
  * Upstream: Fix IA64 assembler (please try this and let me know)
  * Upstream: Fix a static linking the PIC object files on ia32
  * Upstream: Add the version script support for --export-dynamic
  * Upstream: Fix sparc/elf for linux/sparc
  * Upstream: Fix alpha/elf for gcc 3.0
  * Supposedly required for gcc-3.0 usage on many platforms
  * Add s390 to multiarch list (closes: Bug#98095)
  * Supposedly good on mips, but please check.  I emailed Ryan
    to see if bug 98095 still happens, but never got a reply.
    If I get around it, I'll check it myself since my mips
    lives once again.
  * Retake my package from Matt (next time we agree to an NMU,
    please don't change the maintainer name...no wonder I didn't
    get any bug reports!)
  * Cross-compilation support will be added in the next upload
    (I'll be uploading alpha debs with the next release as well,
    the alpha problem outweighs cross-compilation support in
    priority right now).

binutils (2.11.90.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream source (synced with 20010414 CVS)
  * Upstream: Fix in IA64 assembler
  * Upstream: Change Linux/MIPS to use SVR4 MIPS ABI
    rather than IRIX ABI.
  * The above change may cause problems for MIPS.
    If so, please file a bug and I'll revert those
    changes if need be.  I suspect that glibc, gcc,
    and the kernel may eventually follow suit, though
    to fit in with this change (it makes sense...
    see the symbol ordering problems threads on the
    binutils list for more info).
  * Upstream: IA32 gas bug fixed...no further details
    provided, unfortunately.
  * Reportedly fixes core dumping when trying to link
    object files from other platforms (now warns)
    (closes: Bug#60502)
  * Includes Philip Blundell's ARM PLT patch finally...
    sorry for the delay (closes: Bug#94181)
  * m68k problems should be fixed by now.  Wish I had
    gotten more feedback, but I didn't so I'm assuming it
    works at this point (closes: Bug#74396)
  * Stopped compiling cross-compiler packages until we
    work out a better system for the entire toolchain.
    Sorry, but it was taking far too long on even fast
    machines and I've gotten more complaints about the
    current arrangement than I have positive feedback.
    (closes: Bug#91120, Bug#91119, Bug#91118, Bug#91117,
     Bug#91116, Bug#88311, Bug#78028, Bug#90177)
  * Fixed readelf manpage so that it no longer says that
    it is a preprocessor for assembly programs
    (closes: Bug#90798)

binutils (2.11.90.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream source (synced with 20010309
    CVS).
  * Fixed misapplied m68k ld patch.
    I am hoping that this almost totally fixes
    m68k ELF for now.
  * Fixed typo in mips patch and applied another
    mips patch from Daniel Jacobowitz.
  * Should no longer build same-arch cross
    packages.  Please let me know if this fix
    worked so that I can close the bugs (I have
    no access to such an arch at the moment)
  * Made urgency high since m68k really needs
    this if the bugs are truly fixed.  Even if
    not, this version is infinitely better on
    at least two platforms than prior ones were.

binutils (2.10.91.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for SH and IA64 to binutils-multiarch.
  * Applied m68k gas patch from Michael Fedrowitz
    in hopes that this will fix the grave bug that
    has been such a pain to m68k folks.  I'll leave
    the bug open until it's verified that it works
    ok.
  * Applied IA-64 printf patch (closes: Bug#82702)
  * Kernels appear to be building fine with this
    release on all archs available to me
    (closes: Bug#77610)
  * Added text during postinst that informs users
    to modify their i386 kernel Makefiles for the
    --oformat change (closes: Bug#86995)
  * Incorporated remaining mips diffs that weren't
    already applied upstream (closes: Bug#81280)
  * Sparc/sparc64 patch seems to be doing fine, so
    closing the bug (closes: Bug#86781)
  * Added non-linux cross- package support to rules

  * New upstream version.
  * Added weak symbol relocation patch for sparc/sparc64.
  * Included m68k ELF fix from Michael Fedrowitz.
  * BIG NOTE: any i386 kernels compiled with this will need
    to be patched to change the ld option '-oformat' to
    '--oformat' (extra hyphen).

binutils (2.10.1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (really prerel, but better than
    using a CVS version).
  * Should re-add Compaq demangling style to all
    tools (alpha-only).
  * Again, hopefully fixes m68k ELF support...still have
    no idea why or how this was broken before.

binutils (2.10.0.27-0.cvs20001011) unstable; urgency=low

  * Grabbed a new CVS version since it backs out a
    change that prevented current gcc snapshots from
    linking properly to libstdc++v3.  This may also
    solve some other problems related to global
    section symbols (feedback appreciated).
  * Finally changed my email address in the control
    file (how I overlooked this after all of this
    time I'll never know).

binutils (2.9.5.0.37-1) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Was forced to bring the current frozen version up to
    upstream 2.9.5.0.37 in order to fix a rather nasty
    i386 gas bug and also since the existing ARM patch
    applied in 2.9.5.0.31-3 has been superceded upstream
    (closes:Bug#62119)
  * Includes proper demangler support for Compaq compiler
    usage on Alpha (may be superceded upstream shortly,
    but is good enough for potato and for Compaq's usage)
    (closes:Bug#62079)
  * Added cross-compilation support for individual use.
    Please note that the binary packages do not support
    this.  If you require this feature, you need to compile
    the source package changing debian/rules.  Also, if
    you do this, YMMV since things on this front are changing
    rapidly upstream and also because cross-compiling from
    certain platforms to others may not work (i386->alpha,
    for example).  (closes:Bug#59246)
  * Fixed replaces statement in binutils-multiarch
    (closes:Bug#62496)
  * Release Manager: I once again beg that this be included
    in potato.  I've freed up some time to deal with bug
    reports quickly if needed.

binutils (2.9.5.0.31-1) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Yet another patch (this time from H.J. Lu upstream) to fix

    needs to be in potato.  It also fixes the temp file creation
    problem with objcopy on PPC (closes: Bug#60934)
  * New upstream release.  Fixes a serious Alpha bug along
    with a demangler bug and several others (closes: Bug#61121)
  * Should fix apt-get upgrade problem...please test
    (closes: Bug#56175)

    new version, but the ELF bug on Alpha really needs to
    be fixed along with the rest of the above and some others
    not mentioned here.

binutils (2.9.1.0.15-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload with agreement from Chris.
  * Use a different soname for multi-arch libbfd and libopcodes; this
    fixes the problem that the single-arch binaries (as and the diverted
    ones) will all dump core because they're runtime-linked against the
    multi-arch libs. (Fixes: #28656)
  * Due to the above, binutils-multiarch also needs ldconfig in postinst
    now.
  * Fixup diversions once again: Do not even package the ldscripts for the
    native architecture, so diversions for files in /usr/lib/ldscripts
    aren't necessary.
  * Also remove diversions on abort-install.
  * Remove now obsolete diversions in preinst.
  * Also symlink /usr/doc/binutils-multiarch to binutils, and do not
    put /usr/doc/binutils in the package again.
  * Put the symlinks libbfd.so and libopcode.so into binutils-dev, so one
    can link to them.
