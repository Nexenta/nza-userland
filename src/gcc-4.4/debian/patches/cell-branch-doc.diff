+As an extension, the GNU C compiler supports named address spaces as
+defined in the N1275 draft of ISO/IEC DTR 18037.  Support for named
+address spaces in GCC will evolve as the draft technical report changes.
+Calling conventions for any target might also change.  At present, only
+the SPU target supports other address spaces.  On the SPU target, for
+example, variables may be declared as belonging to another address space
+by qualifying the type with the @code{__ea} address space identifier:
+
+@smallexample
+extern int __ea i;
+@end smallexample
+
+When the variable @code{i} is accessed, the compiler will generate
+special code to access this variable.  It may use runtime library
+support, or generate special machine instructions to access that address
+space.
+
+The @code{__ea} identifier may be used exactly like any other C type
+qualifier (e.g., @code{const} or @code{volatile}).  See the N1275
+document for more details.

+@section Adding support for named address spaces
+@cindex named address spaces
+
+The draft technical report of the ISO/IEC JTC1 S22 WG14 N1275
+standards committee, @cite{Programming Languages - C - Extensions to
+support embedded processors}, specifies a syntax for embedded
+processors to specify alternate address spaces.  You can configure a
+GCC port to support section 5.1 of the draft report to add support for
+address spaces other than the default address space.  These address
+spaces are new keywords that are similar to the @code{volatile} and
+@code{const} type attributes.
+
+Pointers to named address spaces can a a different size than
+pointers to the generic address space.
+
+For example, the SPU port uses the @code{__ea} address space to refer
+to memory in the host processor, rather than memory local to the SPU
+processor.  Access to memory in the @code{__ea} address space involves
+issuing DMA operations to move data between the host processor and the
+local processor memory address space.  Pointers in the @code{__ea}
+address space are either 32 bits or 64 bits based on the
+@option{-mea32} or @option{-mea64} switches (native SPU pointers are
+always 32 bits).
+
+Internally, address spaces are represented as a small integer in the
+range 0 to 15 with address space 0 being reserved for the generic
+address space.
+
+@defmac TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_KEYWORDS
+A list of @code{ADDR_SPACE_KEYWORD} macros to define each named
+address keyword.  The @code{ADDR_SPACE_KEYWORD} macro takes two
+arguments, the keyword string and the number of the named address
+space.  For example, the SPU port uses the following to declare
+@code{__ea} as the keyword for named address space #1:
+@smallexample
+#define ADDR_SPACE_EA 1
+#define TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_KEYWORDS ADDR_SPACE_KEYWORD ("__ea", ADDR_SPACE_EA)

+@deftypefn {Target Hook} {enum machine_mode} TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_POINTER_MODE (addr_space_t @var{address_space})

+@var{address_space} if the target supports named address spaces.
+The default version of this hook returns @code{ptr_mode} for the
+generic address space only.

+with machine mode @var{mode} to address space @var{as}.  This target
+hook is the same as the @code{TARGET_VALID_POINTER_MODE} target hook,
+except that it includes explicit named address space support.  The default
+version of this hook returns true for the modes returned by either the
+@code{TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_POINTER_MODE} or @code{TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_ADDRESS_MODE}
+target hooks for the given address space.

+Define this to return true if @var{exp} is a valid address for mode
+@var{mode} in the named address space @var{as}.  The @var{strict}
+parameter says whether strict addressing is in effect after reload has
+finished.  This target hook is the same as the
+@code{TARGET_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS_P} target hook, except that it includes

+with mode @var{mode} in the named address space @var{as}.  This target

+@deftypefn {Target Hook} {bool} TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_SUBSET_P (addr_space_t @var{superset}, addr_space_t @var{subset})
+Define this to return whether the @var{subset} named address space is
+contained within the @var{superset} named address space.  Pointers to
+a named address space that is a subset of another named address space
+will be converted automatically without a cast if used together in
+arithmetic operations.  Pointers to a superset address space can be
+converted to pointers to a subset address space via explict casts.

+Define this to convert the pointer expression represented by the RTL
+@var{op} with type @var{from_type} that points to a named address
+space to a new pointer expression with type @var{to_type} that points
+to a different named address space.  When this hook it called, it is
+guaranteed that one of the two address spaces is a subset of the other,
+as determined by the @code{TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_SUBSET_P} target hook.
