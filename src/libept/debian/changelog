    on implementation details, your code may break now
  * CHANGE: entity::Relation::targetPackages() now traverses Provides:, as it should
  * CHANGE: no more cache::component::Packages::packages( iterator ), use
    packagesBegin() and packagesEnd() or the range accessors instead,

    entries, associate them with their packages, have entity::Desktop to manipulate
    them
  * NEW: SortedRange and UniqueRange adaptors, which present their underlying
    range in a sorted and in the latter case uniquized manner
  * NEW: Range::contains( element ) -- generic implementation only, O(n) so far
    (will optimize later)
  * NEW: aptFront::utils::Comparable mixin (implements > and == in terms of <)
  * NEW: cache::component::Packages::sorted() now gives a name-sorted range of
    entity::Package instances
  * NEW: cache::component::State::{installSize{,String},downloadSize{,String}}
    accessors -- what is needed to get system into currently marked up state
  * NEW: all cache::component implementations now have a Cache &cache() accessor
  * NEW: GeneratedRange, a range defined by a successor functor and a end-test
    functor
  * NEW: cache::component::State::{revert(),replay( range )}, former restores
    state that corresponds to current system and replay( range ) runs a list
    of actions recorded in the range (only one notification is fired)
  * (compatible) rewrite of component::History, more reliable now
  * reduce test data set, remove the download hacks,
  * gettextize, wrap strings that are intended for presentation in gettext() calls,
  * set debugger with DEBUGGER={valgrind,gdb --args} for make test,
