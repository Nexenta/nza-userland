\fBdiffindex-download\fR [ \fBoptions\fR ] \fBURL\fR \fBfilename\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdiffindex-download\fR is a command line tool for
downloading Contents files. It uses APT's diff/Index format patches when
available to avoid downloading the full file.
\fBdiffindex-download\fR is used by
\fBapt-file\fR\&.

download the whole file. Specifying 0 to always download the whole
file is possible.

\fB   -k \fR
Don't verify the peer certificate when using https.
.TP
\fB   -c cacert \fR
If cacert is a directory: Use
cacert as CA certificate path. Otherwise use
cacert as CA certificate bundle. See the
--capath and --cacert
options in the \fBcurl\fR(1) man page.

Don't exit with errror if the URL does not exist. This is useful
