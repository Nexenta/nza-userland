liblzma for Debian
------------------

Upstreamâ€™s library does not have a changing version number yet, so each
distributor has to make up its own soname.  Unfortunately, that means this
package cannot support binaries linked against liblzma from other
distributions.

With version 5.0, this situation should change.  Upstream and its downstream
distributors will strive to maintain compatible versions (with sonames
starting at 5) from that point on.
