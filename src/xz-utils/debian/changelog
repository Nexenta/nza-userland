xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100602-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit d8b41eed.
    - The output from "xz -v --list" and "xz -v -v --list" has been
      improved.
      "xz -v -v --list" can be used to obtain an estimate for the memory
      required to decompress a file.
    - The xz manual page has some new material, including examples.
      Closes: #578465.
    - liblzma: The lzma_block_compressed_size() function no longer
      returns LZMA_DATA_ERROR for valid Blocks.
  * debian/symbols: Bump minimal version for lzma_block_compressed_size.
  * Correct the 4.999.9beta+20100307-1 changelog entry to describe
    which public functions were affected.

  * Add new xz-lzma package to allow xz to provide lzma and related
    commands.  Conflicts: and Provides: lzma.
  * xz-utils: Suggests: xz-lzma.
  * xz-utils/README.Debian: Take xz-lzma into account.

      Thanks to Trent W. Buck for the idea.  Closes: #574583.
    - liblzma: Remove the Subblock filter from the public API
      (the ABI is unchanged).
  * liblzma-dev.NEWS: Update.
  * xz-utils: Update Czech translation.
  * Change priority of xz-utils and liblzma2 to required and
    xzdec to extra.

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100307-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit f4b2b526.
    - liblzma: The stream initialization functions were not correctly
      initializing the internal allow_buffer_error flag.  As a result,
      ever since 4.999.9beta-1 in rare circumstances when decompressing
      LZMA files, the xz tool would produce spurious "Unexpected end
      of input" failures (Gentoo bug 305591).
    - The default memory usage limit on low-memory systems has been
      increased.
  * debian/copyright: Clarify.

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100212-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit eb7d51a3f.
     - xz --force compresses symlinks without complaint now.
     - liblzma: the optimized CRC32 implementation for x86 no longer
       misdetects the Hurd as Mac OS X.
  * debian/rules: ./configure --enable-assembler on the Hurd.
  * xz-utils: Simplify NEWS.Debian.gz.
  * liblzma-dev: Add a NEWS file to keep track of future API changes.

  * Drop unnecessary build-time conflict with autoconf2.13.
  * Add a blank line to the end of all NEWS files.
    (Works around: #247356)
  * debian/README.source: Leave out “-I -i” options.  Ignoring version
    control cruft is the default behavior with dpkg source format 3.0.
  * debian/changelog.upstream.sh: Pass ‘git log’ an explicit --format
    option to avoid problems if format.pretty is set in gitconfig.

  * Correct the 4.999.9beta+20100117-1 changelog entry.  It said:
     + The user-specified memory usage limit was not being honored in
       some cases.
    No such bug was observed, so describe the change instead.

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100131-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit f9dd797a.
     + xz: the --list option to display information about a compressed
       file (e.g., its uncompressed size) is now functional.  The output
       of the xz --robot --list command still may change in future
       versions.
  * xz-utils: NEWS.Debian.gz: Clarify how interleaved output can
    go wrong.
  * debian/rules: Simplify:
     - remove support for comma as a delimiter for $(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS).
     - rely on dh --parallel instead of tricky logic of our own to
       handle parallel builds.  Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 7.4.10).
  * Correct some typos in the 4.999.9beta+20100117-1 changelog entry.
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.4 (checked).
  * Update copyright file.

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20100117-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit 07a11dad.
     + Fix some logic errors in the internal memory usage configuration
       API.
     + xz will no longer compress or decompress special files in place,
       even with --force.
       --force still enables compression of the target of a symlink.
     + xz will no longer read compressed data from a terminal or write
       it to a terminal, even with --force.
     + liblzma: many Index handling API improvements:
        - An lzma_index includes more useful metadata that is not
          actually from the Index.  This is particularly helpful for
          describing multiple-stream files.
           * lzma_index_cat() does not take a stream padding argument
             any more; use lzma_index_stream_padding() instead.
           * lzma_index_memusage() takes two arguments now.
             The new lzma_index_memused() convenience function
             calculates the total memory usage of an lzma_index.
           * lzma_index_count() has been replaced with
             lzma_index_block_count() and lzma_index_stream_count().
           * The new lzma_index_stream_flags() allows storing Stream
             Flags (e.g., checksum types) with the Index information.
           * The new lzma_index_checks() function indicates the list of
             checksum types in use.
           * lzma_index_equal() has been removed.  Its semantics were
             unclear, and something approximately equivalent can be
             implemented by iterating over Blocks in application code.
        - An lzma_index no longer represents a position within an Index.
          The new lzma_index_iter type can be used for that purpose.
           * Certain functions generate an iterator on demand now rather
             than clobbering their lzma_index arguments.  Using a single
             lzma_index for multiple concurrent invocations is safe now:
              lzma_index_buffer_encode(), lzma_index_encoder()
           * Functions that used to specify a Record by modifying an
             lzma_index argument have been renamed and taught to write
             an lzma_index_iter instead:
              lzma_index_locate() -> lzma_index_iter_locate()
              lzma_index_rewind() -> lzma_index_iter_rewind()
              lzma_index_read() -> lzma_index_iter_next()
           * The lzma_index_record type used by lzma_index_read() for
             complex seeks is no more.  lzma_index_iter_next() instead
             takes a parameter of the new lzma_index_iter_mode type.
           * New function: lzma_index_iter_init()
           * lzma_index_init() cannot reuse memory from an existing
             lzma_index any more.  The signature changed accordingly.
     + xz: support for decompressing to a sparse file
        - Try to write a sparse file if the decompressed stream contains
          long runs of null bytes.
        - The new --no-sparse option disables this behavior.
     + xz: add Czech translation.
     + liblzma-dev: lzma_filters_copy() and lzma_filters_update() are
       declared not to throw exceptions.
  * liblzma: bump soname.
  * xz-utils: Add NEWS.Debian describing the sparse file support.
  * debian/rules: Stop explicitly disabling assembler optimizations on
    the Hurd.  The configure script will check if a platform is
    supported.

  * debian/rules: Update clean target to handle comments and wildcards
    in .gitignore.
  * Build-Depends: perl.

  * debian/rules: Speed up build by using autoreconf --symlink.
  * Remove debian/dirs lists.
  * Update copyright file and fix a small typo.

xz-utils (4.999.9beta+20091116-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, taken from upstream commit d315ca4.
     + liblzma: add some new functions:
        - lzma_filters_copy() to copy a filter chain;
        - lzma_filters_update() to change compression options mid-stream;
        - lzma_physmem() to retrieve the total quantity of installed RAM.
     + Fix a design error in liblzma API.
        - Stop requiring caller to maintain filter chain during
          compression.  The library used to read it for new compression
          options.  Callers that need to change options mid-stream should
          use lzma_filters_update() instead.
        - Remove 'persistent' member from struct lzma_options_lzma.
     + xz: add --robot --info-memory options, for front-ends to use to
       read the memory usage limit.
  * liblzma: bump soname; add README.Debian explaining why soname
    differs from upstream.
  * Use source format 3.0 (quilt).
  * Update and clarify copyright file.
