Template: man-db/install-setuid
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should man and mandb be installed 'setuid man'?
 The man and mandb program can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so
 that they will run with the permissions of the 'man' user. This allows
 ordinary users to benefit from the caching of preformatted manual pages
 ('cat pages'), which may aid performance on slower machines.
 .
 Cached man pages only work if you are using an 80-column terminal, to avoid
 one user causing cat pages to be saved at widths that would be inconvenient
 for other users. If you use a wide terminal, you can force man pages to be
 formatted to 80 columns anyway by setting MANWIDTH=80.
 .
 Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by default.
 If in doubt, you should leave it disabled.

Template: man-db/auto-update
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
 If true, automatically rebuild man-db's database when packages containing
 manual pages are installed.
