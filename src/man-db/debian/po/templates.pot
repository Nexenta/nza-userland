"The man and mandb program can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so "
"that they will run with the permissions of the 'man' user. This allows "
"ordinary users to benefit from the caching of preformatted manual pages "
"('cat pages'), which may aid performance on slower machines."

"Cached man pages only work if you are using an 80-column terminal, to avoid "
"one user causing cat pages to be saved at widths that would be inconvenient "
"for other users. If you use a wide terminal, you can force man pages to be "
"formatted to 80 columns anyway by setting MANWIDTH=80."
