vim\-addons \- command line manager of Vim add\-ons
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
vim\-addons [OPTION ...] [COMMAND [ADDON ...]]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
Manage Vim addons installed system\-wide, enabling on a per\-user basis their
installation, removal, ...
.PP
vim\-addons is capable of managing all Vim addons registered in the system\-wide
registry of Vim addons (see vim\-registry(5)). Each system\-wide addon can be,
with respect to a user Vim configuration, in one of the following states:
.TP
.fi
.B
installed
all of the files composing the addon are installed (i.e. symlinked) to their
respective places under the target directory. The addon is fully functional
for the current user
.TP
.fi
.B
removed
the files composing the addon are not installed under the target directory.
The addon might still be working for the current user if it is installed
system\-wide by the local administrator
.TP
.fi
.B
disabled
the files composing the addon are not installed under the target directory,
but the addon is installed system\-wide. However, the addon has been disabled
for the current user explicitly via some configuration line in
plugin/vim\-addons.vim under the target directory. The addon is not working
for the current user
.TP
.fi
.B
broken
only some of the files composing the addon are installed under the target
directory. The addon is probably not working for the current user
.TP
.fi
.B
unavailable
some (or all) of the files composing the addon are missing from the source
directory
.SS COMMANDS
.PP
A number of commands can be given to vim\-addons to inspect or alter the status
of the addons: list, status, install, remove, disable, amend, files, show.
.PP
A description of the semantics of each command is reported below.
.TP
.fi
.B
list
list, one per line, the names of the addons available in the system (i.e. of
all the addons mentioned in the registry, not necessarily of all enabled
addons)
.TP
.fi
.B
status
show, one per line, the status of the addons available in the system. If one
or more addon arguments are specified only show the status of those addons.
This is the default command if nothing is specified.
.TP
.fi
.B
install
install one or more addons under the target directory. Requires at least one
addon argument
.TP
.fi
.B
remove
remove one or more addons from the target directory. Requires at least one
addon argument
.TP
.fi
.B
disable
disable one or more addons to be used by the current user. Usually used for
addons which are system\-wide enabled by the local administrator but that the
current user does not want to be used. Using this command will automatically
change the content of plugin/vim\-addons.vim under the target directory,
probably adding ":let" commands which will inhibit the given addon from being
used.  Requires at least one addon argument
.TP
.fi
.B
enable
undo the effects of a previous disable command. Requires at least one addon
argument
.TP
.fi
.B
files
list, one per line, the files composing the specified addons. Files are
listed relative to components of the Vim runtimepath (see 'runtimepath' in
the Vim help). Requires at least one addon argument
