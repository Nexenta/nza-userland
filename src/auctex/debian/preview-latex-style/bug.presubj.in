#include "variables"
Remember to cover the basics, that is, what you expected to happen and
what in fact did happen.

If the bug (or problem) is triggered by a particular file, you should
try to produce a minimal (the shortest the better) sample file which
triggers the problem and include it in your report.

Your bug report will NOT be automatically sent to the <:=${PLSPKG}:>
upstream developers.  It will be sent to the Debian Bug Tracking System
<URL:http://bugs.debian.org/> instead, where the Debian <:=${PLSPKG}:>
package maintainer will receive it.  He will eventually forward your
report upstream if he thinks it related to the <:=${PLSPKG}:> upstream
sources rather than specific to the <:=${PLSPKG}:> package for Debian.

If you think that your bug report is not specifically related to the
Debian package and would like to send it directly to the <:=${PLSPKG}:>
upstream developers, abort this bug reporting procedure now and follow
the usual bug reporting upstream conventions of <:=${PLSPKG}:> (look in
the <:=${PLSPKG}:> documentation directory "<:$_=${doc};
s|${PACKAGE}|${PLSPKG}|g; print:>").
