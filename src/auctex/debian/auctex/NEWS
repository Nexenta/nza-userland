auctex (11.86-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Parsing of LaTeX output was improved.

  * A new framework for the definition and selection of viewers was
    implemented.  If you have customizations regarding viewers you will
    have to redo them in this new framework or re-enable the old
    one.  *Note the `Starting Viewers' section of the AUCTeX manual, for
    details.

    At a difference from upstream, the Debian package defaults to call
    `xpdf' rather than `evince' as a PDF reader.  Customize
    `TeX-view-program-selection' if you want to change it.

  * Comprehensive editing support for PSTricks was added.

  * Support for various LaTeX packages was added, e.g., `tabularx', `CJK',
    and `hyperref'.

  * An easy way to switch between TeX engines (PDFTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX,
    Omega) was added.

  * Support for SyncTeX was added.  This involves the command line options
    for LaTeX and the viewer.

  * Folding can now be customized to use macro arguments as replacement
    text.

  * `preview.sty' now works with XeTeX.

  * A lot of smaller and larger bugs have been squashed.

auctex (11.81-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Since Debian version 11.81-1, AUCTeX gets auto-loaded by default.  If
  you do not want AUCTeX to override the standard Emacs TeX-mode, you
  may unload AUCTeX completely by evaluating the form "(unload-feature
  'tex-site)" (i.e., put that string into your "~/.emacs" to disable
  AUCTeX completely).

  Since upstream version 11.81, preview-latex comes included with AUCTeX.
  You do not need to do anything special to use it.
