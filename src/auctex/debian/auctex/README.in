#include "variables"
The Debian package <:=${PACKAGE}:>
-------------------<:="-" x length (${PACKAGE}):>


RefTeX
======

AUCTeX users will probably want to switch the very useful RefTeX package on,
by adding something like "(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'turn-on-reftex)" to
their "~/.emacs" (see the RefTeX info manual for more information on RefTeX,
which is part of GNU Emacs).


Font-LaTeX
==========

Starting with AUCTeX 11.01, a new user customizable variable appeared:
"TeX-install-font-lock".  Font-LaTeX it's now the default choice, so users
need not doing anything special to load it anymore.  Emacs 21 users may choose
"tex-font" instead, should they wish it.


On line Documentation
=====================

On line documentation may be found in the info or HTML manual, and in the
<:=${UPDATE_ELISP}:>(8) and <:=${UPDATE_INSTALL}:>(8) manual pages.

TeXInfo sources may be found in the "<:=if($_="${docsrc}")=~tr|/|/|s:>"
directory.


Notes to System Administrators
==============================

A) To improve its performance AUCTeX stores information about TeX macros and
LaTeX styles available on the system in the "<:=${var}:>" directory.

AUCTeX updates this information weekly, by mean of a cron script;
nevertheless, you may want to run "<:=if($_="${sbin}/${UPDATE_ELISP}")=~tr|/|/|s:>"
manually after installing new style files under "/usr/local/share/texmf".

B) You may probably want to customize the list of printers available at your
site.

This could be easily accomplished by declaring it in "<:=${SSEL}:>"
(along with the default printer), for example:

(setq TeX-printer-list
      '(("lp" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpc" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpf" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p")
        ("lpt" "dvips -f %s | lpr -P %p" "lpq -P %p"))
      TeX-printer-default "lpf")

Please, look at the on line documentation, type `C-h v TeX-printer-list RET'
from within Emacs (load AUCTeX first), or browse through the file
"<:=if($_="${lisp}/tex.el")=~tr|/|/|s:>" for more information on this topic.


Contributed Files
=================

There are several files that are not part of AUCTeX proper, but included in
the distribution in case they are useful:

    - `bib-cite.el': better support for bibliographies and much more;

    - `tex-jp.el': Japanese support;

    - `tex-fptex.el': fpTeX support.

Read the comments at the start of each file for more information about how to
load it, what does it do, and who wrote and maintains it.
