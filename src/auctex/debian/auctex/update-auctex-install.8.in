.TH Update\-AUCTeX\-install 8 "19 May 2004" "Debian Project" "Debian GNU/Linux"
.SH NAME
update\-auctex\-install \- update AUCTeX installation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update\-auctex\-install
.RI [ FLAVOR .\|.\|. ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B update\-auctex\-install
script updates AUCTeX installation.
.PP
It should be called after each major (La)TeX installation or upgrade.
.PP
If no arguments are specified, update\-auctex\-install caters to every
supported Emacs flavor installed on the system; else it updates only the
specified flavors, if they are installed.
.PP
On Debian GNU/Linux system
.B update\-auctex\-install
is not called weekly by a
.BR cron (8)
driven mechanism, because it modifies files installed in the
.B <:=${usr}:>
hierarchy, and that would not be policy compliant.  You may call it by hand,
or have the maintainer of relevant packages add a call for it in their
.B postinst
package scripts.
.SH BUGS
None known.
.SH FILES
.B <:=${usr}:>:
the hierarchy containing AUCTeX installed files.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR emacs (1),
.BR tex (1),
.BR latex (1).
