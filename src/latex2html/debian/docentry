Title: LaTeX2HTML
Author: Various
Abstract: LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that that converts 
 documents written in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an 
 easy migration path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents 
 using familiar word-processing concepts. 
 LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a 
 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using 
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references, 
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures 
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting 
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes, 
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted 
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as 
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images 
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final 
 HTML document.  
 LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and 
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also 
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw 
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as 
 new commands and environments from within a  LaTeX document."
