  * This fixes a critical problem with LaTeX2HTML going into an infinite
    loop, rendering the program useless for people. The change involved is
    a single line; we just close an open stream in the child of a
    fork. For some reason, having the stream open in both the parent and
    the child was the source of the problem. This is critical enough to
    break the hard freeze.

  * Added a symlink from Chnages.gz to changelog.gz, satisfies lintian.
  * Added a crude hack to enable LaTeX2HTML from hanging while converting
    problems.tex in the manual (this is a major problem with the package
    that has been reported upstream). I think it is important to get this
    version with the manual in frozen despite a (pretty rare) bug.

latex2html (98.1p1-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Made configure-pstoimg write out to the /etc directory, and some
    minor cosmetic changes for readability. This is a major bug: it should
    not have been writing to /usr/lib
  * Added manual pages for configure-pstoimg and configure-latex2html
  * Added /etc/l2hpstoimg.cfg as a conffile. This is a bug: user changes
    need to be respected.
  * Upgraded to Standards Version 2.4.0.0 (no additional changes)
  * Do not generate a ps file, since the resolution of the printer is
    unknown. Leave the dvi file in so that peopel may generate the ps file
    at will. 
  * closes: Bug#20005

latex2html (98.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The beta versions were never released. This is the new upstream
    release, but there were enoufh source changes to restart a new CVS
    tree. 
  * much faster, and generates much better output.
  * This parses everything I could throw at it (a few glitches exist, but
    lots better than before).
  *  Moved to contrib cause it depends on netpbm, and generates GIF images.
  * The default image type is set to GIF. Can be changed to PNG by running
    configure-pstoimg. (needs pnmtopng to use PGN as default format).
  * closes: Bug#15663

latex2html (98.1b-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * A new (beta) version that is much faster and look quite
    promising. However, they moved icons around internally, to make png
    icons available too, and this messed up the -1 version.

  * Fixed empty section in menuentry that was causing problems with
    menu. This fixes BUG#10773.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jun 1997 16:17:14 -0500

latex2html (96.1.h-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reverted to HTML version 2.0 in the default latex2html.config file,
    sice there have been cases where setting the version 3.1 and using
    math mode lost in a big way; failing to recognize mathrm and other
    environments. 
  * Install the LaTeX styles files in the proper location in the TDS
    (namely /usr/lib/texmf/tex/latex/latex2html).
  * Added commads to postinst and postrm to run texhash if appropiate. 
  * This fixes BUG#9918.
  * This is the first version to be constructed with cvs-buildpackage, in
    fact, we are really useing the pre-release version.

latex2html (96.1.h-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Edited the documentation to reflect the fact that the cnverted files 
    will work just fine when published on a HTTP server using the standard 
    Document Root /var/www, but additional installation may be required if
    a non-standard Document Root is being used.
  * Changed HTML_VERSION in latex2html.config to 3.1 to support HTML tables
    and Font size changes by default.
  * Added symlinks to icons under /var/www so that the files converted by
    LaTeX2HTML can be viewd directly using a HTML browser, or put in a 
    directory visible from the local HTTP server and viewd through the HTTP
    server. The solution is ugly, but it works, and should fix BUG#8536
  * Changed maintaner name in control file as well
