  * SECURITY [CAN-2004-0976]: patches from Trustix for insecure temp
    file usage (thanks to Joey Hess for analysis; closes #278404).

perl (5.8.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    databases created with earlier perl packages will need to be
    upgraded before being used with the current module with the
    db4.0_upgrade program (in the libdb4.0-util package, with HTML docs
    in db4.0-doc).

  * NOTE: suidperl is now deprecated upstream and support is expected
    to be discontinued for 5.10.  Package description amended.

  * Update included debhelper subset to 3.0.36.
  * Changed perl-base depends to pre-depends.

    + Move autoloaded routines from POSIX to perl.
    + Strip pod from modules into separate .pod files, distributed
      with perl-doc.

    + Add Getopt::Long.
    + Add File::Glob (closes: #95238).

  * Add a place-holder perldoc script to the perl package which

    the perl(1) page.

  * Remove perlfilter docs, newer versions of which are included in
    the libfilter-perl package (closes: #88485).

  * Patch perl5db.pl to fall back to "/usr/bin/pager" rather than
    "more" if $PAGER is not set (Debian Policy 12.4, closes: 94462).

  * Add conflicts/replaces/provides for libansicolor-perl (closes:

  * Add Build-Depends on netbase, as some tests require /etc/protocols
    (closes: #88365).

  * Add /usr/local/lib/site_perl back to @INC (note: not created by
    installation) to allow local modules to be installed in a
    non-versioned directory and to pick up local modules installed
    with the previous packages (closes: #87831).

  * Don't strip debugperl binary (closes: #88801).
  * Change man3ext to 3perl as man will otherwise select perl's
    open(3) over open(2) for example.

  * Apply upstream change 7428 to fix Universal::isa (reported by Joey
    Hess).

  * Move locale.pm to perl-base (requested by Joey Hess).
  * Move attributes.pm to perl-base.  Used internally to support
    subroutine attributes such as :lvalue.  This should allow debconf to
    depend only on perl-base (closes: #77399).

  * Add replaces/provides/conflicts for libpod-parser-perl to the perl
    package.  Note the programs are in perl, and the modules in
    perl-modules although the latter don't actually conflict as the
    directory is different (closes: #86459).

  * Choose one libreadline-*-perl package to suggest, as having both
    with an | was tickling an obscure bug in apt-get.

  * Patch perldoc to warn rather than die on non-existent dirs in @INC
    as not all directories may exist in a debian installation, the
    site directories for instance are created by MakeMaker on demand
    (closes: #86690).

  * Fix Getopt::Long documentation for the require_order option
    (closes: #86683).

  * Add a suidperl link for those who wish to use #!/usr/bin/suidperl

    configure/build/install a threaded perl locally if required.

    diagnostics module works without perl-doc being installed.
    (Closes: #86154).

  * Add /usr/lib/perl5/5.6 to @INC to handle arch-indep module packages
    which didn't set privlib to /usr/lib/perl5.  (Closes: #86122).

  * Add conflicts to libcgi-fast-perl for libcgi-pm-perl (which
    includes a different version of that module).

  * Apply _PATH_LOG patch from previous packages to fix Sys::Syslog,
    which croaks if you pass an extra argument to syslog.

  * Fixed POSIX.xs to work on ia64 (forwarded upstream).
  * Applied patch 7565 which fixes Errno.pm (was not being created
    correctly with gcc-2.96).

perl-5.6 (5.6.0-6.2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Brendan O'Dea <bod@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Dec 2000 16:36:26 +1100

perl-5.6 (5.6.0-6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * Ensure that a valid /usr/bin/perl exists before each instance of
    "update-alternatives --remove" in perl-5.6-base.postinst, as any
    of these may possibly blow away the symlink.  (Closes: #76432).

  * If an alternative existed for perl.1p.gz before installation, the
    file of that name in this package was removed in the postinst
    update-alternatives.  The same goes for cperl-mode.el.  Install
    versioned files and manually link like the rest of the
    alternatives mess.  (Closes:  #78742, #79728).

    Note that both of these changes to alternative handling are merely
    stop-gap measures.  The situation still remains that installing
    perl-5.004 or 5.005 after 5.6 has been installed will play merry
    havoc with the symlinks again and stands a good chance of nuking
    /usr/bin/perl if subsequently removed.

  * make.versions:  rename rather than copying files so that we don't
    ship two copies of each binary in the .deb (linked to canonical
    name in postinst).

  * Move warnings::register to -base.  (Closes: #79075, #79234).
  * Move autosplit.ix for File::Glob to -base.  (Closes: #77384)
  * Move load_imports.al for POSIX to -base.
  * Move IO.pm to -base.
  * Move dangling libperl.so symlink to libperl5.6.

    Remove references to syslog.ph - 07_syslog_path_log.
  * The debug target now uses ./Configure -deS to make it not look for a
    tty. (closes: #77009)
  * Fix make.base so it works for the newer version number. (closes: #47204)
  * Add base.pm to perl-5.\d+-base for debconf (closes: #77145)
  * Add XSLoader.pm to perl-5.\d+-base.  Many module authors thought Dynaloader
    took to much memory; XSLoader is a much smaller version.
    (closes: #77280, #77292)
  * Add File::Glob to perl-5.\d+-base so those scripts using globbing work under
    5.6.  (closes: #77384)
  * Add libdb2-dev to the Build-Depends list.  (closes: #77758)
  * Downgrade perl-5.\d+-suid to optional.  (closes: #77841)

  * Make the patched target append each patch as it goes to the 'patched'

  * rm config.sh.static in clean target
  * Shorten the make targets for building the static Perl:
    - Now, build target builds both the static Perl and the libperl with
      extensions and such.
    - Only Perl and suid Perl get built.  We don't need to build the
      extensions when we're about to blow them away.
    - We also wait performing the tests until we have the shared Perl.
  * Actually get the paths correct for Perl, using a colon separated
    privlib and archlib.
    This uncovered 2 documentation and 1 Configure bug in Perl.
  * Make NDBM_File use libgdbm's ndbm emulation instead of libdb's since
    DB_File can't handle null keys currently. -
    debian/patches/04_NDBM_uses_libgdbm
  * Perl 5.6 has to conflict with the old data-dumper package.  Since the
    package isn't available anymore in potato or woody, this shouldn't be
    a problem.
  * incpush will create duplicate path entries in @INC if either
    vendorlibexp or sitelibexp don't end in the version number of Perl.

perl-5.005 (5.005.03-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This needs to be put into frozen so that Alpha has the correct
    syscall.ph constants (important bug #55794) and the copyright on the
    perl-policy is correct (important bug #60233)
  * Changed copyright on perl-policy.sgml from "the Debian Project" to
    "Software in the Public Interest".  This is so the document is
    actually copyrighted by a legal entity.  This closes: bug#60233.
  * Completely regenerated the *.ph files.  There appears to be a clean
    separation these days of system specific stuff into the asm
    directories.  The only question would be the stuff in the bits/
    directory since that seems to be autogenerated by the kernel.
    The only one that I know needs it is bits/syscall.ph.  I've written a
    script to make sure it takes in all the syscalls as necessary.
    Note that this is a somewhat long job since h2ph only does a 90% job,
    so the generated .ph files take a bit of hand-editing.  This closes:
    bug#55794.
  * Install the Perl Social Contract (Porting/Contract) into the doc
    directory of the perl-5\d+-doc package.  This closes #51963.
  * Modified lib/ExtUtils/MM_Unix.pm so that if the environment variable
    NO_LD_RUN_PATH is set true, then MakeMaker won't use LD_RUN_PATH in
    the dynamic_lib method and therefore the .so won't have an rpath built

perl-5.005 (5.005.03-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Many changes to make Perl build on Hurd from Marcus Brinkman, closes:
    Bug#31621.
    - Update debian/README to partially reflect the current situation; no
      need to type root password; the problem with locales was fixed long ago.
    - Update debian/copyright to talk about Debian rather than Debian/GNU;
      There are now many O'Reilly books on Perl.  Don't mention a number.
    - Convince debian/make.base and debian/make.versions to use
      $cpu-$system rather than $arch.
    - Use linux and gnu as acceptable systems in debian/make.base
    - Don't try to mkdir with '/' on the end of the name in debian/make.base
    - Skip packages we don't build in debian/make.versions
    - Change all maintainer scripts to use =cpu=-=system= rather than
      =arch=
    - Many changes to debian/rules to allow for conditional testing (not
      on arm, hurd) and conditional building of threads (not on hurd,
      5.004)
      I think this is the last thing (other than debian/control) that is
      different between the builds.  I'll parameterize debian/control on
      the next build and we'll be happy.
  * Change the paths in debian/rules and debian/perl-policy.MK to be FHS
    compliant.
  * Make the postinsts/prerms install/remove the compatibility symlink for
    the move from FSSTD to FHS.
  * Fix debian/make.versions to be FHS compliant as well.
  * Use -fPIC in the cccdlflags so that Perl compiles with -fPIC everwhere
    instead of -fpic in some places.  This now complies with policy and
    closes: Bug#41587, #43930.
  * Have make test actually use make test-notty so as to not die on
    automated compiles.  Closes: Bug#33225.
  * Use unlink instead of system("rm -f ...") in debian/make.base.  I seem
    to've gotten carried away using cp -a a while back and used system
    instead of unlink. Brain needs to be on...
  * Change the mention of the location of the GPL and Artistic copyright
    files in debian/copyright from /usr/doc/copyright to
    /usr/share/common-licenses.
  * Fix Getopt::Long so that the documentation of the require_order
    configuration option is now correct closes: Bug#39180.
  * Embedding works now.  It's probably as Tom Rothamel
    <tom-pine-1@onegeek.org> said; Perl just needed to be recompiled with
    glibc2.1.  Closes: Bug#38615.
  * In gv.c, Fix for 'use Safe;' with -w segfaults from Sarathy installed.
    Closes: Bug#38533.
  * In handy.h, only #define HAS_BOOL due to _G_HAVE_BOOL if we're using
    g++.  _G_HAVE_BOOL is defined in _G_config.h.  This will probably be
    included in a gcc program since stdio.h includes libio.h which
    includes _G_config.h.  Thanks to Greg Stark <gsstark@mit.edu>.  This
    can be closed once it is tested.
  * Namespace was cleaned up a while ago, closes: bug#33844.
  * Complaining locales was fixed a while ago, closes: bug#30207.
  * Perl has been compiled with glibc for a while, closes: bug#29452.
  * rename has been included, closes: bug#26616.
  * cperl-mode is installed in the right place now, closes: bug#24249.
  * Specify man1dir in Configure so that it goes to the FHS compliant
    place.
  * Fix the paths for $(LIBDIR)/ExtUtils/inst $(LIBDIR)/ExtUtils/xsubpp
    $(LIBDIR)/File/DosGlob.pm to make lintian happy.
  * Make $(LIBDIR)/ExtUtils/inst $(LIBDIR)/ExtUtils/xsubpp executable to
    make lintian happy.
  * Remove $(LIBDIR)/CGI/Fast.pm since we don't include FCGI.pm.  This
    satisfies lintian and closes: bug#44544.
  * Applied patch from Jim Pick <jimpick@jimpick.com> that adds the
    appropriate arch-specific *.ph files in debian/.ph/asm-arm.  This
    would close bug#44605 but it's requiring some *.ph files he doesn't
    supply.  Mail sent off to him about this.  Got
    .ph/arm-arch/proc/shmparam.ph from him.  Closes: bug#44605.
  * Add Porting/patchls to /usr/bin, fix its path.
  * install-doc should show be used in both remove && upgrade for prerm.
    Add stuff to debian/doc.postinst to deal with this problem.
  * Added re.pm and friends to perl-5.\d+-base.  This closes: bug#45552.
  * Removed the large number of extra POSIX autoloader modules.  The
    locale stuff that's part of POSIX don't need these.
  * I've already moved to /usr/share/man in this package and so, this
    closes: bug#45678.

  * Fix Config.pm's startperl to be /usr/bin/perl (or
    /usr/bin/perl-thread) when the build is done.
  * Fix the installman[13]dir's in Config.pm so a simple perl Makefile.PL;

  * Make perl-$(version)-thread provide perl5-thread so packages using
    perl-thread don't have to depend on a versioned perl-thread.
  * No longer conflict with data-dumper so that it can remain installed
    while perl-5.004 and the older packages need it.
  * No longer ask if we should abort during the preinst.  Perl 5.004 isn't
    diabled with the installation of Perl 5.005, so there is no reason.
  * Convince commands with no manpages that they should have an
    unversioned symlink installed by update-alternatives.
  * Installed updated eg/rename as a command.  eg/rename was updated by
    Robin Barker <Robin.Barker@npl.co.uk).
  * Added the Perl Policy to the doc package.  Registered it with
    doc-base.  I'll install the other docs with it later.

  * Fix typo in perl-base.postinst (=version instead of =version=)
  * Add all of POSIX.pm,.so,.al to perl-base in an initial attempt at
    supporting Internationalization in the base disks.
    We'll need to remove *.al files that aren't necessary and put them in
    perl.
  * Automate the update-alternatives lines for the man pages for
    perl-thread.  This way when another Thread::*.3pm comes along, I don't
    have to notice, it will.
  * Add/Remove /usr/local/lib/site_perl/$arch-linux-thread in
    thread.postinst/prerm if /usr/local/lib is writable.
  * Fixed missing parens around $version when moving perl.1p back to perl
    from perl-doc
  * Mentioned installing 5.004_05 in copyright file as well as correcting
    the path to CPAN on www.perl.com.
  * Add Debian changelog to perl-base.
  * Remaining typo fixes from Raphael:
    /usr/man/man1/perl-=version=.1p.gz in postinst
    startperl should be #!/usr/bin/perl-$(version)
    the asm *.ph directories should be =version=/=arch=-version
  * perl-$(version)-base should conflict with perl-base rather than perl.
    This way, if someone has never installed the full Perl package, they
    still conflict until all the non-versioned Perl is gone.
  * rename threadperl-5.005 to perl-5.005-thread.  Raphael is right;
    tab-completion is handy.

  * Made perl-version-doc Recommend perl-version instead of just Suggest
    it.  perl-doc should only not be installed in special cases.
  * Made perl-version-thread Priority: extra instead of optional.
    Considering the experimental nature of threaded Perl right now, I'd

  * Changed description of perldebug to say that it shows internals of
    Perl and helps debug Perl.  (Fixes Bug #17547).
  * Changed the permissions on suidperl to give group and world read
    access.  It makes no sense to restrict read access when anyone can get

  * Included target to add a comment to the changelog so that an automatic
    package from untarring this in a new perl subversion works with the
    correct version.

perl (5.003.07-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed perl, perl-suid, and perl-debug to section interpreters.
    Changed perl-base to section base.
  * Changed rules to determine the perl version dynamically so that it
    doesn't have to be editted for each new version.
  * Rebuld and upload so that perl will just pre-depend on libc5.4 rather
    than libc5.4.17-1.  This and -5 were destined for stable and 5.4.17-1
    isn't available for that.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Fri, 17 Jan 1997 19:04:13 -0800

perl (5.003.07-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved config.over.MK to the debian directory so that all the files
    that I add are there.
  * Just ignore the mkdir on /usr/local as the easiest solution to the
    NFS-ro /usr/local problem.  Suggestion by Guy Maor <maor@ece.utexas.edu>.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Fri, 10 Jan 1997 02:13:22 -0800

perl (5.003.07-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed problem with suidperl.  It will actually run suid now.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Sun, 15 Dec 1996 23:56:59 -0800

perl (5.003.07-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add check to postinst to check for old perlconfig created include
    directories and removed them.
  * Made perlbase's Config.pm use the correct install paths
  * Made perl provide/replace/conflict with perlbase to replace it
    properly
  * No longer put libperl.a in suidperl since we not doing shared perl.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Thu, 12 Dec 1996 23:40:09 -0800

perl (5.003.07-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Perl to provide io as well as conflict with it since it's been
    subsumed into the main perl distribution.
  * Applied patch from Nick to make use FileHandle; work transparently
    although is should be use IO::Handle (or other appropriate IO::)
  * Applied patch from Randy so that use sigtrap doesn't complain anymore.
  * Applied patch from Paul that changes use strict tie; into a warning.
  * Changed perl back to a static libperl
  * Developed and packaged a perl-base to go on the base-floppies.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Thu, 21 Nov 1996 04:13:51 -0800

perl (5.003.07-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * added code to postinst/prerm that only creates the empty
    /usr/local/lib/site_perl directory if /usr/local/lib is writable by
    root (fixes Bug #5003)
  * Updated to dpkg standards version 2.1.1.0  (fixes Bugs #3874, 4709)
  * Pre-generated all the *.ph files that people will probably need.  The
    correct asm directory will have a symbolic link set during postinst.
    (fixes Bugs #4493, 4739, 1856, 3770, 3277, 3803, 3814, 1099, 3784,
     1201, 1170, 3908, 2405, 4717, 2184, 1411, 2440)
    I wonder if this is a record for the most number of bugs fixed by a
    change.
  * Changed debian.rules to generate a shared libperl for the main
    executable with a static suidperl and debugperl.  This should help
    Fast-CGI, nvi, and if folks are using the compiler.
  * Edited the copyright file to reflect current reality rather than
    bygone days (fixes Bug #2589)
  * Added Pre-depends: ldso to control file in case the user upgrades ldso
    at the same time they upgrade Perl. (fixes Bug #2589)
  * Made sure that all files in the examples directory
    (/usr/doc/perl/examples) were readable (fixes Bug #3995, 4615, 4734,
    4870)
  * Added symbolic link /usr/doc/perl/examples to point to the examples
    directory. (fixes Bug #3997)  (this is obsoleted by new standards)

	  remove the tcsh once c-shell is provided by it.
	* Changed the suidperl from being a question in the postinst to
	  being it's own package.

	  dependent on the specific version of perl.  We'll see if this
	  causes a problem in upgrading.

	* Removed find lines in debian.rules binary install since

	  what extensions to use for for man1 and man3.
	* Changed references to /usr/local and perl5.000 in the man pages
	* Changed references in scripts from /usr/local to /usr
	* Setup config.over file to fix-up config.sh to install into
	  debian-tmp/usr/* instead of trying to do it in sh.  The shared
	  libs weren't going in the right place.

	  platform with a.out being secondary.

Perl 5.001 Debian 6 (5.001n) - 04-11-95 Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Updated to 5.001n: big patch, small problems remain.
* debian.rules now passes definitions to Configure, instead of running
  Configure with a modified hints/linux.sh.
* Use a variable in debian.rules to test the binary format.
* With ELF, DB_File support is disabled (rather ad hoc).

* ELF version has GDBM support; depends on elf-libgdbm

* Updated to 5.001m.

Perl 5.001 Debian 3 - 5/9/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* Fixed Bug#219.  h2ph was making output which didn't work.
* put magic in the postinst to fix it.  This opens the can
* of worms whereby I fix all of h2ph's messups.  Ugh.

Perl 5.001 Debian 2 - 5/8/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* Added dialog.pl interface to dialog for Jim Robinson

Perl 5.001 Debian 1 - 3/1/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>

* merged all of the unofficial patches from the perl5-porters mailing list.

Perl 5.000 Debian 4 - 3/1/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* h2ph now makes all useful headers.

Perl 5.000 Debian 3 - 2/28/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* called h2ph to make the handy perl headers.
* Put the example code and emacs modes in /usr/doc

Perl 5.000 Debian 2 - 2/27/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* generally fixed it up so it was useful for debian.
