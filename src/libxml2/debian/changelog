libxml2 (2.7.7.dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Use build_python* instead of build-python* as build

    .install. Cope with builds which don't have any dist-packages (or

      that we don't have to build the base libxml2 library several times.
    + Deduplicate in /usr/lib/pyshared, not
      /usr/lib/python-support/python-libxml2.

      inviting to use dpkg-source -b.
    + Force -Wl,--as-needed at the beginning of the gcc command line.
    + Simplify rules by switching to dh.
    + Don't refresh COPYING during clean target, it appears not to be
      necessary anymore.

  * debian/python-libxml2.install: Install python files from
    /usr/lib/python*/dist-packages.
  * python/generator.py: Sort python generated stubs so that libxml2.py
    doesn't differ between python 2.5 and 2.6.

    builddir != srcdir.

libxml2 (2.6.16-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/watch: use svn-upgrade instead of uupdate.

    Added support for several python bindings packages. Currently for python
    2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.

    bytecompiling files at install time and removing them at removal time.
    Closes: #300834.

libxml2 (2.6.15-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * error.c: Removed support of validation errors in structured error handler.
    That avoids it to crash when a validation error happens. (That was a
    broken feature added in 2.6.15. This will get properly fixed in 2.6.16).
    Closes: #279040.

 -- Mike Hommey <mh@glandium.org>  Mon,  8 Nov 2004 22:16:00 +0900

libxml2 (2.6.15-1) experimental; urgency=low

libxml2 (2.6.11-5) unstable; urgency=high

libxml2 (2.6.14-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #273961.
  * debian/rules: Use "dh_makeshlibs -V 'libxml2 (>= 2.6.14)'", since version
    2.6.14 introduces some new symbols.
  * debian/shlibs.local: Removed, since it is not useful any more.

 -- Mike Hommey <mh@glandium.org>  Sat, 16 Oct 2004 16:29:06 +0900

libxml2 (2.6.11-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "let's do some clean up for sarge" release.
  * debian/libxml2-python2.3.install: don't install .a and .la files.
  * debian/rules: Avoid compression of both python examples and documentation.
  * Reorganization in documentation:
    + debian/libxml2-doc.examples: removed, they will get installed by
      libxml2-doc.install, and we don't ship gjob* examples anymore, they
      have been superseded by a lot of better examples.
    + debian/libxml2-doc.install, debian/rules: changed the way files are
      installed in the libxml2-doc package, and their location.
    + debian/libxml2-doc.doc-base: changed the location of the documentation
      base to fit the new one.
    + doc/examples/index.html: generated this file from examples.x?l by
      hand. It would otherwise require a build dependency on xsltproc, itself
      depending upon libxml2... wouldn't be very reasonnable.
  * debian/no-upstream-changelog, debian/rules, debian/libxml2-dev.dirs,
    debian/libxml2-utils.dirs: /usr/share/doc directories have been replaced
    by a symbolic link in packages libxml2-utils and libxml2-dev.
    In libxml2-python2.3, all files but TODO are symlinks to the corresponding
    file from libxml2. The one from libxml2-doc is replaced by an explicative
    text saying where to find it and why it has been (re)moved.
    That will save some space in the archive, especially considering this
    file is constantly growing.
  * debian/README.Debian: Added a recommentation to upgrade package if user
    needs heavy standards compliance.
  * debian/shlibs.local: Added to tighten dependencies between libxml2-*
    packages.
  * xmlIO.c: Fixed typo (Closes: #265740).
  * nanohttp.c, nanoftp.c: no_proxy environment variable doesn't disable proxy
    anymore. (Closes: #266430)
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Removed the workaround to compile with
    gcc-3.2 on hppa, since $254549 is closed.

  * python/drv_libxml2.py: add encoding declaration. Closes: #259526.
  * debian/rules: Backup files that are removed or modified by upstream build
    system and restore them so that calling the clean target actually gives
    the same tree as before a build.

 -- Mike Hommey <mh@glandium.org>  Sun,  1 Aug 2004 05:02:14 +0900

libxml2 (2.6.11-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    the scope. Closes: #250177.
  * debian/rules: rename libxml.m4 to libxml2.m4 in the /usr/share/aclocal
    directory.
  * libxml.m4: removed the AM_PATH_XML macro which is a macro for checking
    libxml, not libxml2. Changed CFLAGS to CPPFLAGS from test compiles so
    that using C++ also works. Closes: #249033.

    libxml2 has been stucking packages in sid.

  * debian/rules:
    + Removed all python file removals since these files get now
      correctly removed upstream.
    + Changed once more the python/libxml2-py.c workaround to finally
      work really properly.

    from entering testing for too long.
  * Grabbed from SVN:
    Mike Hommey <mh@glandium.org>  Sat, 10 Apr 2004 12:42:03 +0900
    * debian/control:
      + Updated section for libxml2-doc package.
      + Added dependency on libz-dev for libxml2-dev. (Closes: #242683)

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Apr 2004 22:37:08 +0200

libxml2 (2.6.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/rules:
    + Use "dh_makeshlibs -V 'libxml2 (>= 2.6.8)'", since version 2.6.8
      introduces some few new functions.
    + Try to circumvent new troubles with the python/libxml2-py.c with
      svn-buildpackage not wanting to make the build (the file used to
      be removed because it was modified by the build).
  * Removed changes about XML_CATALOG_FILES in manual pages, since it has
    been incorporated upstream.

libxml2 (2.6.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Changed Maintainer to Debian SGML/XML Group and

libxml2 (2.6.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    + Added a Recommends: xml-core to libxml2 package.
    + Added a libxml2-headers and a libxml2-docs packages to split
      arch-dependent and arch-independent files. These files used to be
      in the libxml2-dev package. Note that the new libxml2-dev package
      depends on libxml2-headers, so that upgrade will keep the header
      files on the system, but libxml2-headers only suggests libxml2-doc,
      while libxml2-dev doesn't say anything about it, which means that
      the documentation files won't be automagically installed on your
      system.  Closes: #233405.
    + Added the adequate dependencies between new and old packages.
    + Uniformized short descriptions.
    + Slightly modified long descriptions.
  * debian/rules:
    + Externalized all dh_* calls with arguments. (i.e. created
      corresponding debian/package.dh_stuff files)
    + Moved installation of some doc files to the install target.
  * Removed un-needed debian/libxml2-python2.3.docs.
  * Moved libxml manpage from libxml2 to libxml2-dev.
  * doc/xmlcatalog_man.xml: Added a note about the incompatibility between
    xmlcatalog and update-catalog from xml-core in the man page.
  * doc/xmllint.xml, doc/xmlcatalog_man.xml: Added a note about the
    XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable. Closes: #232728.

libxml2 (2.6.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: should be API and ABI compatible but got a lot
    of changes.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use "dh_makeshlibs -V 'libxml2 (>= 2.6.0)'", since applications
      using the new API won't work on previous versions.
      Note that this doesn't prevent applications built with older versions
      to work properly with newer releases, since it is not supposed to be
       any API/ABI breakage.
    - Don't remove non-existant python/test/tmp.xml file on clean rule.
    - Remove python/libxml2-py.c file on clean rule, to avoid its changes
      made during build to be stored in the diff file.
    - Added handling of the nostrip DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    - Changed old fashion dh_movefiles to dh_install --sourcedir=debian/tmp.
    - Added installation of the python/TODO file in the libxml2-python2.3
      package.
    - Now take what is installed in debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/... for
      documentation.
    - Copy Copyright file into COPYING file in clean rule to avoid
      unrepresentable changes to source.
  * debian/*.files: renamed to debian/*.install.
  * debian/libxml2.install: removed reference to non-existant
    usr/lib/libxml.so.*

    For some reason the library has changed name from libxml to libxml2 and
