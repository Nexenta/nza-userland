guile bindings for gnutls.

Guile binary extensions currently use dlopened dynamic libraries installed in
/usr/lib/. These are not to be used a C-libraries. Which is why ...
 - we do not provide shlibs files for these
 - and the .so symlink is not in the dev-package.

(Thanks to Ludovic Court√®s for the explanations.)
