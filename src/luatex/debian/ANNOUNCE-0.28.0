Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.28.0, another
intermediate release leading up to TUG 2008. This release
matches SVN revision #1357.


There is one new feature:

There is now experimental support for non-trivial discretionaries
following explicit hyphens. In analogy to \prehyphenchar and
\posthyphenchar, there are two new parameters \preexhyphenchar en
\postexhyphenchar. Both new parameters default to zero (nothing).
When set to a nonzero value, the parameter is added to either the
pre- or post- break text. Note that this is *in addition to* the
hyphen already in the input. Testing and comments are very welcome.

Here is a short example (no idea what is says):

   \pdfoutput=1
   \hsize=2in
   \postexhyphenchar=`-
   Seria bom se eu
   pudesse t\^e-lo mantido como amigo, mas por
   mais bem-intencionado que eu fosse, n\~ao
   foi possivel
   \bye



Bugs fixed compared to 0.27.0:

* Words that started off with a character with a zero \lccode
   were never hyphenated at all.

* There was a bug in the new active characters code that prevented
   the latex format from being built (with Invalid character error).

* There is a temporary fix for the sometimes appearing "Font has a
   bad FontBB" message from Acrobat.

* \leaders did not actually stretch enough (the last bit of glue
   that has to line up the line endings was never output to the PDF).

* Bad paragraph-related callbacks could result in luatex crashing.

* The pre_linebreak and post_linebreak filters were never called
   when \output was active (this was a leftover of a superceded
   optimization).

* 'skipping' language codes when setting up \patterns c.s. did not
   work (it used the next empty slot instead of the actual value of
   \language).

* Using multiple 'attr' keywords on box items could cause random
   crashes.

* Calling lang.hyphenate() with one argument (without specifying a
    tail node) could crash.

* The luatex pdf banner and version reporting is cleaned up a bit.

* Conflicting patterns inside \patterns now give an error:
     ! Conflicting pattern ignored.
   (duplicate identical patterns are ignored without error).


The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
