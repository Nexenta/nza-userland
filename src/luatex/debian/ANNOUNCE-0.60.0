Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.60.0.

This release starts a new chain of stable beta's, and will be the
version included in this year's TeXLive.

New features:

* os.name now knows about CYGWIN (from Elie Roux)

* Internal handling of direction specifiers is faster now.

* Each glyph node now has three new virtual read-only fields:
   width, height, and depth (values in scaled points, of course)

* There are new functions node.protrusion_skipable() and
   tex.badness() (useful for paragraph breaking in lua)

* Also new: tex.linebreak(). See the manual for details.

* All lua errors now report file and line numbers to aid in
   debugging.

* Import of metapost 1.211.

* pdf.pdfcatalog will be replaced soon by the new pdf.catalog
   pdf.pdfinfo will be replaced soon by the new pdf.info
   pdf.pdfnames will be replaced soon by the new pdf.names
   pdf.pdftrailer will be replaced soon by the new pdf.trailer

* pdf.pdfmapfile and pdf.pdfmapline are replaced by the new
   pdf.mapfile() and pdf.mapline() functions. (a function interface
   fits these parameters better because they never return anything).

* New read-write lua variables: pdf.pageattributes, pdf.pageresources,
   pdf.pagesresources

* getluatexsvnversion.sh now correctly detects git-svn and still
   manages to find a valid SVN revision number (from Patrick Gundlach)

* Many of the source files have been converted to CWEB.

Bug fixes:

* GNU libtool is now used to solve the various technical issues with
   dynamic loading of lua modules.

* Error detection in scan_integer_part was wrong due to missing
   initialization of OK_so_far (spotted by Javier Mugica)

* Synctex was broken in 0.51-0.52.

* \lastlinefit was broken since ... well, nearly forever.

* Reading of binary files with length zero was broken.

* Trapping of unitialized rules (this was for sloppily created
   rule nodes from lua)

* pdf.immediateobj('streamfile') was broken on 64-bit platforms.

* tex.linebreak did not take the given left and right skip, but
   instead used the current TeX-side values (bug #356).

* the found 'MAKE' command in build.sh is now fed into configure to fix
   problems with that not finding GNU make even when it is actually
   installed.

* dofile(<nil>) and loadfile(<nil>) in batch mode now give an
   error and continue instead of pointlessly waiting for user input.

* Reverted commit #3417 (the buildpage experiment) as it causes bad
   things to happen when items are waiting during page breaks.

* Overrule loaders[4] in --safer mode, make require() behave
   closer to normal lua 5.1, and add some nicer error messages
   (based on an email and patches from Manuel Pegourie-Gonnard)

* Added an extra sanity check for GDEF loading in luafontloader,
   based on a crash caused by Linux' AkaashNormal.ttf.
