Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.47.0.

This will be the last beta before the next major release (0.50),
so please test this version as thoroughly as you can.

New features:

* New read-write lua variables pdf.pdfcatalog, pdf.pdfnames,
  pdf.pdfinfo, pdf.pdftrailer

* The horizontal mode nodes that are added to lines during line
  breaking now inherit the attributes from the first and last node
  inside the created line.

* The new function pdf.registerannot(<number>) registers an
  annotation object number to be included in the current
  page's /Annots list.

* The variables <metrics>.Mathconstants.FractionDelimiterSize
  and <metrics>.Mathconstants.FractionDelimiterDisplayStyleSize
  are added to the font table. This allows proper setting of the
  size parameters for TeX's ...withdelims math primitives.

* The internal representation of the string pool is reorganized
  (the pool of string characters is now allocated dynamically),
  and as a side-effect the lua variable status.init_pool_ptr
  is deprecated and will be removed in a later version. Also,
  status.pool_ptr now simply returns the current number of bytes
  in use for string characters.

* There are new lua variables pdf.pdfmapline and pdf.pdfmapfile
  (write-only strings that mimic \pdfmapline and \pdfmapfile).

* \pdfobj data and attribute are now stored as C strings instead
  of as token lists (this should speed up cases with a lot of data).

* Artificially slanted fonts now work via the pdf text matrix
  (instead of adjusting the actual font) so that it now also
  works for non-Type1 fonts. The lua <metrics>.slant font key is
  now obeyed in all cases.

* The lua function font.id(<string>) returns the internal font id
  number belonging to a control sequence name.

* Pdf image inclusion is optimized such that objects from an
  external pdf will now be included only once even if they are
  referenced from multiple inclusions.

Bug fixes:

* Protrusion for non-TLT documents did not work properly for
  the hyphenation character.

* \lastbox could not remove the paragraph indent box for non-TLT
  documents.

* Pdf images (\pdfximage) are no longer kept open during the
  whole run, but closed and reopened. An error is raised if
  the file has changed between \pdfximage and \pdfrefximage.
  This prevents the 'too many open files' error when lots of
  images are included.

* On Win32 Pdf image files are locked during the time that it is
  open, to prevent unnoticed file changes by external sources.

* Compilation now again works on FreeBSD.

* Format sharing between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures was
  broken.

* Unsetting attributes from lua could sometimes result in
  the unset state persisting beyond the current group level.

* If something went wrong in the scanning of pdf action items,
  the error message reported the current primitive name
  incorrectly.

* Luatex would crash on non-existant pdfs that were referenced
  from map file entries.
