Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.43.0.

New features:

* There is a new allowed key in the table trhat is returned
  by lua-loaded fonts: <f>.psname. This value should be set
  to the original PostScript font name of the font. Fonts inside
  dfont and ttc collections are fetched using this field
  (if it is missing, <f>.fullname will be used instead).

* It is now possible to use Apple dfont font files
  (those that contain at least one outline font).

* \latelua is now allowed inside leaders.

* There is a new callback: process_output_buffer, from Manuel
  Pégourié-Gonnard. This callback is called just before
  \write acts, so it can be used to alter the file encoding
  of text output files.

* There is a new node.dimensions() function, which calculates
  the natural size of (part of) a list of nodes.

* The new primitive \gleaders provides 'globally aligned'
  leaders.

* The DVI and PDF backends now share much code internally.

* The embedded MPlib is now 1.207.

* libpng is now 1.2.39.

Bugfixes:

* We fixed lots of anonymous bugs introduced in 0.42.0 (as expected)

* fontloader.info() errors are no longer fatal, the function now
  just returns a nil,"error string" pair.

* Automatically inserted kerns for \accents are now once again
  valid word ends, as in \TEX.

* Fixed the placement of math displays in mixed direction
  settings.

* The \pdfcompresslevel is now dynamic again.
