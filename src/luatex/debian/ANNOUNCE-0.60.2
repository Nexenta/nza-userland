Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.60.2,
a bugfix release for the 0.60 branch.

Bugfixes:

* Various small portability fixes, especially for non-gcc
   compilers.

* Updated synctex from Jerome Laurens.

* fix bug #406: \pdfliteral hinders hyphenation.

* fix pdf overprinting bug (related to \pdfliteral).

* patch from Akira Kakuto that ensures that only absolute commands
that are inside the %PATH% will be executed in win32's restricted
\write18

* fix a buffer overflow in luafontloader.

* fix cross-platform share-ability of generated formats.

* fix a few typos in the manual.

* fix trashing of the null glue spec by attribute reference code.

* documented the deprecated state and brokenness of otp processing.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:
