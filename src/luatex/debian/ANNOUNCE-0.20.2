Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.20.2. This
is a simple bugfix release for last week's beta:

* some portability fixes to the build scripts
* a fix for multi-\span in alignments causing unbreakable
   loops
* manual improvements from Jonathan Sauer
* fix for undefined csnames in \directlua if
   web2c's hash_extra is nonzero
* fix for LR text inside of a RL document
* fix for open_read_file callback not being called
   unless find_read_file was also registered
* removed the ocp status message when \ocps are not
   actually used
* "unicodeenc" in the fontforge to_table renamed to
   "unicode" for improved consistency

I have uploaded source and linux/win32 binaries to

       http://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/luatex/

Have fun,

Taco
