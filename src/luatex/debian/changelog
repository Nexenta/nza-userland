    New:
    * pfb+afm fonts can now be used in 'wide' (encodingbytes=2) mode
    * searching in PDFS using 'wide' fonts now works reasonably well
      (based on the tounicode feature)
    * related to that, tounicode information can now be passed

    * font subsetting is now supported for CID-based OpenType fonts
      (however, there is a known bug with KpozMinProVI-Regular.otf)

      and passed on to the lua code as a second return value of
      the fontforge.open() function

      the TeX error for "Font not found"
    * The lua function font.current can now be used to set
      TeX's current font
    Fixes:
    * set_attribute(-1) is now the same as unset_attribute()

      so that luatex can quit a bit more gracefully
    * an assertion failuer on systems with signed chars (linux-powerpc)
      is fixed
    * a crash on AMD64 linux was fixed
    * the lua "pdf" table code was wrong
    * \ifcsname did not work properly for UTF-8 characters
    * Use of the math-related functions using make_fraction (like
      \atop) caused a crash
    * \handling of \if\noexpand was wrong
    * applied a patch that cleans up XForm and page calculations
