Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.27.0. This is
an intermediate release leading up to 0.30.0, to be released
around TUG2008.

There are just too many changes to wait another month :-)

Bugs fixed compared to 0.25.3:

* Unicode reencoding support for non-standard (i.e. older)
   Type1 fonts is now somewhat less broken than it was (#25)

* .vf fonts using specials crashed luatex

* luatex would crash on --\par (#33)

* An attempt is made to get a sane default value for StemV in
   the created pdf (#32)

* We can now guarantee that %PDF-1.* header is printed before
   the first pdf.print() output

* lang.hyphenate() was broken

* insert_before(a,a,b) was broken (#37)

* argv[0] is now cleaned up before being used as a default for
   mem_name and prog_name (#28).

* luatex would crash on loading extended fonts (fonts loaded
   via lua callbacks) from a format file.

* The fix for pdftex bug #799 is backported from pdftex 1.40.4.

* slnunicode had a bug in the unicode.utf8.gmatch iterator.

* Queries of nonexisting fontdimens could cause a crash.

* luatex would crash on {\textdir TLT\pardir TLT x\break\par }

* Fixed wrong placement of lines in mixed-direction paragraphs
   that could happen in some situations.

Other news:
* Luatex now includes luasocket (#35)
   See http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~diego/professional/luasocket/
   for usage.
   There is a new commandline option: --nosocket to disable this,
   and that is also implied by --safer.

   NOTE to the binary builders: there are some unfixed configure
   problems when you need to add a specific library to get socket
   support on your platform. You probably will have to edit the
   generated Makefile by hand (search for 'socketlib').

* There is ongoing development to the 'img' and 'mplib' libraries.
   See the reference manual for details.

* The 'character commands' in virtual fonts now support image
   inclusion. See the reference manual for details.

* Lua error messages now include the call stack.

* \directlua and \latelua have been extended to accept a 'name'
   keyword. The argument is a token list that is used as the lua
   name of this chunk in lua error messages and call stack prints.
   (#42)

* The lua chunk names can be interfaced via a new virtual
   table called lua.instancename, the values in that function as
   defaults in the absence of 'name' keywords.

* The 2-plane limit on active character range is removed (#12).

* Subsetted TTF fonts in the PDF now retain the cmap table.

* There is a new Lua variable os.selfdir. This contains the
   full absolute pathname of the directory that the executable
   resides in (with symlinks resolved)

* There is a new function os.uname() this returns a lua
   table containing various platform information items.

* The node library now uses text strings for direction specifiers
   instead of numbers. See the reference manual for details.

* The 'E' (edit) as error response functionality is now a noop.

* Adding luatex 0.25.3 to texlive resulted in a few minor backports,
   in particular: Support for mktexfmt is added, and luatangle now
   identifies itself as such (instead of calling itself otangle).

* We fixed a whole series of portability problems (but
   we probably introduced new problems as well).

* Most (all?) files now have a corrected Copyright header,
   and link in $Id$ and  $URL$ into the object file.

* Some unnecessary files were removed from the distribution.

The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
