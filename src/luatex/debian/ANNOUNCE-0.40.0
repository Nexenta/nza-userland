Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.40.0 to the foundry server,
and will commit the source code to texlive later today.

What's new:

* The embedded MPlib is updated to version 1.200.

* Texlua would crash if run font.read_tfm() was used.

* Luatex would crash on empty \patterns.

* Lots of small C code cleanups.

* \textdir inside a \hbox dir *** was wrong earlier.

* 0.39.0 introduced a bug that would make luatex crash whenever
  font expansion was used.

* Font tables returned by define_font can now have a key named
  'cache' that controls the internal lua font table caching.

* There is no longer a need for an explicit --progname if there
  is no input file given.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co svn://scm.foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.40.0

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco
