Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.50.0.

This release starts a new chain of stable beta's.

New features:

* Fonts now listen also to the 'extend' key in the lua font
  metrics table, and the processing for this is done via de
  pdf text matrix instead of via the font matrix, which means
  it now works for all font types.

* The embedded Metapost library is now at version 1.209.

Dropped features:

* It is no longer possible for fonts from embedded pdf files
  to be replaced by / merged with the document fonts of the
  enveloping pdf. This regression may be temporary, depending
  on how the rewritten font backend will look after beta 0.60.

Bug fixes:

* Use of \middle confused the \mathstyle operation.

* \pdfcolorstack handling was broken.

* node.unset_attribute() had a bug whereby it inverted the
  requested result in some cases (the node on which the unset
  was called was sometimes the only node at the current level
  that *kept* the attribute).

* During font expansion, the internal font copy had one character
  information object less than the original, resulting in the
  disappearance of a glyph in some fonts when font expansion
  was active.

* Placement of operator scripts of OT MATH fonts is adjusted
  to be conformant with Word's logic where the italic correction
  is only used to tuck in the subscript and for nothing else.

* luafontloader.open() no longer writes directly to stderr in
  case of internal font errors.

* Any <pdf_refobj_node>.objnum could not be assigned to.

* The lua 'pdf' table could not be assigned to.

* The lua 'md5' library was returning incorrect results on
  64-bit architectures.

* Luatex now compiles on GNU Hurd systems.

* Fix segfault when embedding stream file object (these
  backend segfaults were a side-effect of the string pool
  patches).

The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:
