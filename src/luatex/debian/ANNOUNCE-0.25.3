Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.25.3, yet
another bugfix release to the 0.25 series.

Bugs fixed:
* Pdftex bug no. 936 (sarovar) regarding vertical
   positioning of embedded PDF files if depth parameter is given.
* Luatex gave bogus lua return values for the tex.wd/hd/dp
   values of void boxes
* A few bugfixes in mplib (square pens caused hangs, elliptical
   pens caused confused output)
* Hyphenation of uppercase words (\uchyph) was broken
* Output image placements corrected for all 8 transform cases
   also when artbox etc. is used
* There were missing maketexstring() calls in error messages
* Math display contents were sometimes prematurely freed during
   the placement of the equation number
* Setting \language=-1 could cause crashes due to an array
   index going out-of-bounds

Other news:
* build.sh.ppc is added to the source distribution. This is a
   script that crosscompiles osx ppc binaries from osx intel
* tex.box[<chardef name>] is now supported (but still experimental)
* a bunch of compiler warnings are removed
* The fontforge library now dump AAT feature tags as and
   "<id,flags>" string
* The new function font.nextid() predicts the next assigned font id
* Some source code changes are backported from texlive

The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
as usual:

Have fun,
Taco
