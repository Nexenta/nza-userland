Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.44.0.

There are not a lot of new features yet, but this releases fixes
a fair amount of bugs found in 0.43.0 (and earlier versions).

New features:

* libpng is now 1.2.40.

* hlist nodes now have a subtype to distinguish hlists generated
  by the paragraph breaking, explicit \hbox commands, and other
  (as-yet-undefined) sources.

* \pdfobj now has an extra optional keyword: 'uncompressed',
  which forces the object to be written to the PDF in plain
  text (see the manual for the exact details).

* The lua file from the luamd5 library (which provides the
  md5.hexsuma() function) is now embedded in the executable.

Bug fixes:

* \latelua now works in DVI mode again.

* status.output_file_name could crash when used too soon.

* In 0.43, rules were not output at all in DVI mode.

* \leavevmode\penalty-10000\penalty-10000 crashed luatex.

* the API of margin kern nodes to lua was using the wrong
  fields in the nodes.

* A few fixes to the manual.

* PDF Xref stream dicts were slightly non-conformant.

* There was too much space between two consecutive math displays
  (this bug was inherited from Aleph)

* Synctex was broken (thanks, Akira)

* Font mark classes were handled incorrectly by the fontloader
  code.

* There was a crash possible with certain types of named PDF
  destinations.

* Math delimiters and large operators in new MATH fonts no
  longer apply the italic correction (this fixes placements
  of super- and subscripts on such items for those fonts).

* The converter from lua strings to token lists (for the node
  interface) sometimes generated invalid tokens.

* CFF (OpenType) fonts now listen to 'embedding="full"'. TTF
  is still todo.

* Font tables with 'embedding="no"' would cause luatex to crash.

* \pdfobj file {} failed to find the file if there was no lua
  callback in place.

* An optimization in MS Mincho caused luatex to crash.
