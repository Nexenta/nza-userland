Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.40.4 to the foundry server,
and have committed the source code to texlive.

What's new:

* \the\textfont0 returned a number instead of doing a font switch.

* The embedded MPlib is now 1.203.

The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.40.4

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco
