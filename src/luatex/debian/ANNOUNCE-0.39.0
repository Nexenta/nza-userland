Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.39.0.

This is the last beta before 0.40.0, and we consider it to be
feature complete now. The difference between 0.39.0 and 0.40.0
will be nothing more than a newer version of MPlib, improvements
to the manual, and (probably) a few bugfixes.

What's new:

* iniluatex will from now on start up with only the TeX82 primitives
   and \directlua, everything else has to be bootstrapped via
   tex.enableprimitives(). This change was planned for 0.40.0,
   but *now* is the time to test it.

* A bugfix for \primitive in various expandable contexts,
   and \primitive now generates an error message when the
   argument is not actually a primitive's name.

* There was a bug found in the math accent handling.

* Large math operators are now treated like extensible characters
   in the sense that they can be composed of segments.

* The extra assign- and restore tracing information from eTeX
   had a massive bug because of a dangling else in the pascal web.
   As a side-effect of fixing this bugs, all such potential errors
   in the pascal web have been fixed (for now).

* The math parameters can now be set and queried from lua code
   via the new tex.setmath() and tex.getmath() functions.

* Reflection in a \hbox was broken.

* There was a leak of direction nodes in the paragraph builder.

* The font backend now does a small peek to differentiate
   truetype and postscript style opentype fonts. This fixes
   the "Can't find CFF table" bug for otf's with truetype outlines.

* Parameters and registers can now also be assinged to globally
   from lua (see the manual for details).

* It is now possible to query the current math style while a
   formula is still being constructed by using the new read-only
   value \mathstyle. Associated is the new command \Ustack that
   is to be used as a prefix for {.. \over ..} and friends.
   See the manual for more information.

* The embedded MPLib is brought up to date with the current
   metapost repository (version 1.110 and a few small patches).

* Luatex can now handle two breakpoints inside a single ligature
   (like for the functional word of-f-ice). The solution is not
   perfect yet, but the chance of missed hyphenation points in
   actual documents should now be negligible.

* Some speedups in the font loading code, and in the handling of
   pdf_literal nodes that are set from within Lua code.

* Some source code and manual cleanup, as usual.
