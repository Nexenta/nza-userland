tcl8.4 (8.4.19-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't remove tclsh alternative in case of package upgrade because the
    manually installed alternative is also removed which isn't desirable.

tcl8.4 (8.4.19-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed clean target to work with debhelper 7.0 (made dh_clean the last
    command, so debhelper logs are removed now).

tcl8.4 (8.4.18-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quoted CFLAGS in debian/rules when passing to the shell, not when
    assigning to a make variable; otherwise the quotes end up as part of
    the variable and many things go wrong, leading to a build failure
    (closes: #467397, #476015).
  * Explicitly specified configure options --host and --build to make build
    results more predictable.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules.

tcl8.4 (8.4.18-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Overridden lintian warning package-name-doesnt-match-sonames since tcl8.4
    package contains not only a library, and it's unreasonable to split it
    into smaller parts.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 08 Feb 2008 21:35:49 +0300

    closes: #447310, #447311).

tcl8.4 (8.4.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added -fno-unit-at-a-time option to prevent stack corruption in a
    particular use case (closes: #446335).
  * Added /usr/local/lib/tcltk, /usr/local/share/tcltk, /usr/lib/tcltk,
    /usr/share/tcltk to auto_path variable. These directories are to be
    contain Tcl/Tk packages according to upcoming Debian Tcl/Tk Policy
    (preliminary version see at
    http://pkg-tcltk.alioth.debian.org/tcltk-policy.html/)
  * Removed TCL_INC_DIR from tclConfig.sh and tcl.m4.
  * Moved architecture independent files from /usr/lib/tcl8.4 to
    /usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.4. To keep backward compatibility tclConfig.sh is
    linked to /usr/lib/tcl8.4 directory.
  * Fixed bug with update-alternatives in prerm scripts.
  * Removed conflicts with tcl and providing tcl-dev packages from
    debian/control to prepare binary packages for default tcl and tcl-dev.
  * Removed build-essential package from tcl8.4-dev dependencies.
  * Moved tcl.m4 to /usr/share/aclocal/tcl8.4.m4 to make it easier to use
    different versions of tcl.m4.
  * Removed alternative of tcl.m4 (the link to default tcl.m4 is to be
    maintained by tcl-dev package).
  * Rearranged conflicts of tcl8.4-doc package because of planned adoption of
    real tcl-doc package.

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]
  * Added Homepage field in debian/control.

    sources.
  * Cleaned up patches in debian/patches directory.
  * Added /usr/lib/tcl8.4 to a search path for tclConfig.sh and /usr/lib/tk8.4
    to a search path for tkConfig.sh in tcl.m4.
  * Removed patch which replaced strcmp by strcoll in lsort -ascii since
    it doesn't make sense for unicode Tcl strings.
  * Removed hack which fixed random crashes on SMP machines (it doesn't crash
    anymore, but needs additional testing).
  * Removed patch which fixed build-failure on sparc in tclPosixStr.c since it
    is not necessary anymore.
  * Added uscan control file debian/watch.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility to 5.

  * Needed to fix mechanism for picking up SONAME.  Now uses special
    macro, TCL_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS, and only for Linux, Hurd and DebianBSD.

 -- Chris Waters <xtifr@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Sep 2005 13:32:03 -0700

tcl8.4 (8.4.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed old patch for integer conversion on 64-bit systems, as
    upstream seems to have created their own patch, which conflicts.
  * Added a new patch (courtesy of James Troup and Ubuntu) which fixes
    crashes on SMP machines, but may introduce some resource leakage on
    very unusual apps - this is, we hope, only a temporary patch until
    upstream comes up with a better solution (closes: #285062).
  * The old mechanism for renaming the man pages no longer worked, so I
    had to create a new one.

 -- Chris Waters <xtifr@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Dec 2004 18:48:10 -0800

tcl8.4 (8.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed patch files for tcl.m4, they were badly out-of-synch, and I
    don't actually use them for anything.

 -- Chris Waters <xtifr@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Aug 2004 20:42:08 -0700

tcl8.4 (8.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-enabled XIMPEEK which has been fixed to work with newer XFree86es.

 -- Chris Waters <xtifr@debian.org>  Thu, 31 Jul 2003 01:32:31 -0700

tcl8.4 (8.4.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt to not use XIMPEEK code, which doesn't work with newer
    versions of XFree86.  This really only affects Tk, but there's a
    passing reference to it in tcl.m4, so I'm removing it from there as
    well, just to make extra sure that it's gone.

 -- Chris Waters <xtifr@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jun 2003 18:10:17 -0700

  * Added debian-netbsd patch from Joel Baker.

 -- Chris Waters <xtifr@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Mar 2003 19:53:44 -0800

tcl8.4 (8.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    dh_movefiles processes the packages, and no longer uses obscure
    globbing magic.
  * Include the actual upstream changelog file, as well as the file named
    "changes" (which is more of a user-oriented description).
  * Applied new Hurd patch from Robert Millan, hacked up a bit after
    talking to upstream (closes: #170449).

tcl8.4 (8.4.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the man page patch introduced in 8.4.0-2, as it was large, and
    didn't actually help.  Re-added the "ln" hack to mkLinks (as seen in
    earlier tcl packages).

 -- Chris Waters <xtifr@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Oct 2002 18:59:36 -0700
