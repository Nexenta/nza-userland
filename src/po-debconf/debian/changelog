  * Apply patches from 1.0.15ubuntu1
    - Fix opportunistic import of Mail::Box::Manager, to avoid crashing with
      an import error if libmail-box-perl is not installed.  Now it actually
      shows the "Please install libmail-box-perl" message, as the code intends
      to. Thanks to Colin Watson for suggesting this fix!
    - Drop libmail-box-perl to Suggests:. It is not needed for most users of
      po-debconf, drags in lots of more packages, and with above fix the
      failure mode of podebconf-report-po is adequate.

    files, which should not occur though.

    by Thomas Huriaux, thanks.  Closes: #354583

  * podebconf-report-po: Sort PO files.

po-debconf (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/po-debconf.7.pod:  Improve the "Update templates" section to
    explain that debconf-updatepo needs to be run manually, or better
    called from the 'clean' target of debian/rules, so that PO files
    shipped in source packages are up-to-date.  Closes: #338998
    Thanks Thomas Huriaux.

  * doc/fr/po-debconf.fr.7.pod doc/ru/po-debconf.ru.7.pod: Update

  * podebconf-report-po: If package version number can be found in
    debian/changelog, put it into mail's subject so that translators

  * Remove debconf2po-update.1, this program has been renamed three
    years ago, so the transition phase is over.

  * Add Russian man pages.  Closes: #337750
    Many thanks to Yuri Kozlov.

  * debian/control: Drop dependencies on libmime-base64-perl, this package
    had been merged with perl in sarge.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Dec 2005 10:26:40 +0100

po-debconf (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * po2debconf: Default output encoding is now UTF-8, which means that
    if your package has a debian/po/output containing '2 utf8', you
    can remove this file and depends on 'po-debconf (>= 0.9.0)' to
    achieve the same result.

  * debconf-updatepo: Speed up merging PO files by calling msgmerge
    directly instead of intltool-update.

  * debconf-updatepo debconf2pot: Do no more modify templates.pot header
    comment.

  * debconf-updatepo: If a 'control' file is found in the parent directory
    of PO files. put its Maintainer field into the Report-Msgid-Bugs-To
    header field of templates.pot.  Since po-debconf 0.7.0, this file is
    updated only when its content has changed (in order to prevent unneeded
    commits), so Report-Msgid-Bugs-To will be updated only when some msgids
    are modified.  You can remove templates.pot before running
    debconf-updatepo if you want to add this field to all your PO files.
    Note also that this works only with intltool-debian >= 0.34.1+2005082.

  * po2debconf: Replace iconv by msgconv to recode PO files when encoding
    is set to 'popular'.

  * debian/control: Depends on gettext >= 0.12 because debconf-updatepo and
    po2debconf now rely on features added into this version.

  * podebconf-report-po: Document the --gzip flag in the --help output.
    Closes: #313280

  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version: 3.6.2

  * podebconf-report-po: Add an X-Mail-Originator field containing the
    version number of this script; this may help debugging when problems
    arise.
  * podebconf-display-po: This script displays translated strings only if
    user's environment is localized.  This restriction is added into the
    documentation.

    this restriction is removed, PO files can have any name.  Closes: #301199

    and environment variable DEBEMAIL is set, use this value as mail
    sender.  Thanks Christian Perrier for this suggestion.
    Closes: #288532
  * podebconf-report-po:  Add --submit/--bts command line flags.  The
    former file a bugreport, and the latter send usual notices to
    translators and inform them that they can send their translations
    to the given bugreport.  Thanks again Christian Perrier for this
    suggestion.  Closes: #288533
  * podebconf-report-po:  Mail headers can be modified when editing mail
    body, this is explained by comments on top of the body message.
  * podebconf-report-po:  8bit characters are replaced by question marks
    in mail headers.  This does not fix #292815, but at least generated
    mails are no more invalid.
  * Put these changes into documentation.
  * debian/control:  Lowercase the first letter of the short description.

po-debconf (0.8.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * po-debconf.7.pod:  When debconf-updatepo is called in the build
    target, PO files are not updated in the source package.  The right
    solution is to call it in the clean target.  Thanks Martin Quinson.
  * Update French documentation.

po-debconf (0.8.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * debconf-gettextize:  Fix a warning (uninitialized value) when
    translated templates have no Type fields. Closes: #234816
    Thanks Martin Quinson
  * Bump dependency: intltool-debian (>= 0.30+20040211)
    to prevent generation of broken templates files if comments appear
    juste above a Template: line.
  * po2debconf:  Make warning and error messages more coherent.
    Better handling of temporary files.
  * Official language code for Norwegian Bokm√•l is redefined from "no"
    to "nb".  Petter Reinholdtsen asked on debian-edu@l.d.o. that
    po-debconf helps this transition; po2debconf now prints a warning
    if no.po exists (and generates Field-no localized fields), and when
    nb.po is found both -nb and -no localized fields are generated.
    Norwegian translators are thus encouraged to rename their no.po
    files into nb.po to provide the best support for users.
    Closes: #235756
  * po2debconf.1:  A note written by Petter Reinholdtsen about the above
    issue is added to documentation.  French documentation is updated.

po-debconf (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depends on intltool-debian (>= 0.27.2+20031023) so that template
    type is added as a comment in PO files.  Automatic comments in
    PO files previously looked like
      #. Comments extracted from source files
      #. Description
    and now
      #. Type: select
      #. Description
      #. Comments extracted from source files
    Author comments are the most important part, so put it near English
    text to catch translators' attention.
  * debconf-updatepo debconf2pot:  Set INTLTOOL_DEBIAN_TYPE=po-debconf
    to print template type in PO files.
  * podebconf-display-po:  New utility to launch a debconf interface
    based on templates found in a PO file.  Translators can then check
    their translations before sending them.
  * doc/po-debconf.7.pod:  Clarify how to mark Default fields as being
    translatable, previous version was somewhat incorrect.
  * doc/fr/po-debconf.7.fr.po:  Translation update.

po-debconf (0.8.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * debconf-gettextize:  Add a --unsafe flag to allow processing
    even if msguniq is missing.
  * debian/README.Debian:  New file containing more detailed
    explanations about the above.  Suggested by Andreas Metzler, thanks.
  * po-debconf(7):  Update documentation to tell that comments
    can be inserted in templates files and copied into PO files.
    Thus add Depends: intltool-debian >= 0.27.2+20031003 to make
    sure that it does work as written in the documentation.
    Previous intltool-debian versions silently discard these comments,
    there is then no need to add a versioned build dependency against
    po-debconf when using this new feature.
  * Update French documentation.
  * po2debconf:  Better error message when iconv fails
  * Bump Standards-Version: 3.6.1  (no changes needed)

  * debconf-gettextize:  Final instructions now tell to edit debian/rules
    to generate the localized templates file.
    (Closes: #198867)  Thanks Martin Quinson
  * po2debconf:  If a PO file is older than the master templates file,

    run debconf-updatepo from debian/rules when templates file is
    edited.  (Closes: #185886)
  * debconf-updatepo:  debian/po/templates.pot was generated for each
    language, it is now generated only once.  When --verbose flag is
    set, statistics are more readable.
  * debconf-updatepo:  POT file will be renamed later into debian.pot
    because doc-base and other packages might want to use these tools.
    In order to provide backward compatibility, if debian.pot does
    exist, it is updated; otherwise templates.pot is used.

po-debconf (0.6.7) unstable; urgency=low

po-debconf (0.6.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debconf-gettextize:  When argument is named templates.in, strings
    were not extracted into templates.pot because it is considered as

po-debconf (0.6.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * po2debconf:  Error messages reported by intltool-merge did appear in

po-debconf (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Internal change:  In order to prepare doc-base support,
    intltool-merge now adds encoding in localized fields, and
    po2debconf removes them when output format < 2.
  * When field value is a comma separated list, an extra leading
    underscore tells po-debconf that items have to be put in
    separate msgids.  This is a new localized field format, there
    is no reason to convert all _Choices field to __Choices, but if
    their value changes quite often, it may ease translator's life.
    (Closes: Bug#171649)
  * po2debconf:  Fix a bug when dealing with extra text used to make
    msgids unique, it was removed too early.

po-debconf (0.5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dependency against perl >= 5.8.  Adrian Bunk pointed out
    that File::Spec is shipped in woody, and debconf-gettextize has
    been slightly changed not to require Perl 5.8 at all.
    But gettext 0.11 is still needed by debconf-gettextize.
  * po2debconf:  sort intltool-merge command line flags.
  * encodings: ro charset is assumed to be ISO-8859-2 instead of
    ISO-8859-16.  Thanks to Bela, who translated adduser template.
  * intltool scripts:  upgrade to latest CVS.
  * RFC822 files can now have a tab at first column, it is treated

  * --name is a new command line flag of pod2man, so do not use it
    in doc/Makefile until sarge is released.

po-debconf (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debconf2po-update:  Abort when templates.pot file is not created,
    and remove some superfluous output.
    (Closes: Bug#166112, #166114, #166115)  Thanks Branden Robinson.
  * debconf-gettextize debconf2po-update debconf2pot:  Make header text
    more descriptive in POT and PO files.
  * debconf2pot:  Fix for multiple input files.
  * debconf2po-update:  When there are no *.po files, do not abort but
    call debconf2pot in order to generate templates.pot.
  * intltool-extract:  Remove warning about multiply defined msgids.
  * When locale is set to UTF-8, Perl reads and writes UTF-8 data, and there
    seems to be no way to make it read bytes instead of chars.  For this
    reason, LANGUAGE, LANG and LC_ALL environment variables are unset.
    Thanks Martin Sjogren.

po-debconf (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * po2debconf:
      + Replace --encoding=traditional by --encoding=popular.
      + Default output value is set to 2, which means that
        Description-de.ISO-8859-1 or Choices-ru.KOI8-R fields are printed
        instead of Description-de and Choices-ru.
      + When po or UTF-8 encoding is used, always set output value to 2.
        (Closes: Bug#163597)  Thanks Tomohiro Kubota.
      + Format may also be specified in debian/output file, e.g.
          echo '2 utf8' > po/output
  * debconf2po-update:  POTFILES.in was searched in directories
    po:debian/po:../po in that order, and now in debian/po:po:../po
  * Update intltool scripts with latest CVS
  * intltool-extract:  In PO and POT files, sentences in a multi-paragraph
    string were not displayed in input order.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Oct 2002 22:11:28 +0200

po-debconf (0.4.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dependency against GNU libc, since this is a required package
    and all ports use it.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Oct 2002 20:42:36 +0200

po-debconf (0.4.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace Depends: libc6 by libc6|libc6.1|libc0.3 in debian/control.
    so that po-debconf is installable on alpha, ia64 and hurd-i386.
    (Closes: Bug#163507)  Thanks Ryan Murray.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Oct 2002 18:55:57 +0200

po-debconf (0.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * README:  Improve documentation.
  * debconf-gettextize:  Minor change in output message.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Sat,  5 Oct 2002 17:07:57 +0200

po-debconf (0.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debconf-gettextize:  When there are multiple input files, some
    messages could be multiply defined.  Thus msguniq is called
    to remove duplicates (shipped with gettext >= 0.11).
  * debconf-gettextize:  Fuzzy entries were marked with '#. fuzzy' instead
    of '#, fuzzy'.  PO files generated by previous versions should be
    manually checked to perform this substitution.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Oct 2002 22:08:36 +0200

po-debconf (0.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * po2debconf:  Text::Wrap was producing wrong output with some master
    templates files because $Text::Wrap::break had an incorrect value
    in /usr/share/po-debconf/intltool-merge
    (Closes: Bug#163160)  Thanks Joey Hess.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Oct 2002 19:17:45 +0200

po-debconf (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to *unstable* since there has been no bug reported since 0.4.0,
    and po-debconf seems now quite mature.
  * debconf2pot:  Without argument, default input file is templates and
    not _templates.
  * Various doc fixes.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Tue,  1 Oct 2002 21:21:38 +0200

po-debconf (0.4.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * debconf-gettextize:  It was broken when arguments are in another
    directory.  The File::Spec module is used in order to call the
    abs2rel method, which implies that po-debconf depends upon
    perl >= 5.8.0.
    Since debconf-gettextize is only run by developers, translators
    may backport po-debconf to woody.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Sep 2002 21:03:47 +0200

po-debconf (0.4.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Rename _templates into templates in order to help developers migrating
    to po-debconf format.  (Closes: Bug#161372)  Thanks Joey Hess.
  * debconf-gettextize:
      + Accept several master files as arguments, and thus -F flag is
        removed because it is useless.
      + Add short option for --lang and --new-templates.
      + The --lang flag can be set more than once to specify several
        languages.
      + Run debconf2po-update when finishing, unless -n flag is used.
  * po2debconf:
      + Replace -n, -u and -E flags by -e.  This new option sets encoding
        conversion, arguments is taken amongst: po (no conversion), utf8
        (convert to UTF-8) and traditional (convert to legacy encoding).
        The latter is the default until sarge is released, then default
        will be utf8.
      + -O flag is obsolete, output format may be changed by the
        debian/po/output file.  Localized fields are written foo-xx, and
        foo-xx.enc if debian/po/output contain 2.
        When sarge is released, default will be 2 and backports only need to
          echo 1 > debian/po/output
  * Split man pages so that each program has its own one.
  * debian/control:  Remove dependency against debhelper, in order to
    let debhelper depends upon po-debconf if dh_installdebconf needs to
    call po2debconf.  Thus dh_installpodebconf is no more installed.
  * debconf-gettextize po2debconf:  Prevent line break between spaces,
    because a wrapped line beginning with a space cannot be reformatted.

  This is a release candidate for moving away from experimental, next
  upload will go to unstable unless major changes are needed.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Sep 2002 23:56:23 +0200

po-debconf (0.3.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * New README-trans file with instructions for translators.
  * po2debconf:  As explained in README-trans, developers are encouraged
    to replace in their _templates files _Default by _DefaultChoice when
    template type is Select or Multiselect so that translators are warned
    they must not translate this string, but instead change its value taken
    from original Choices list.  Thus po2debconf must revert this change,
    since debconf does not recognize this field.
  * intltool-extract:  Fix line numbers 
  * debconf2pot:  Add comments in POT file
  * debconf-gettextize:  Change default PO directory, it is now
    `dirname $1`/po
  * debconf2po-update: search PO directory in ./po, debian/po and ../po

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Sep 2002 00:42:23 +0200

po-debconf (0.3.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * intltool-extract intltool-merge:  When reformatting paragraphs,
    replace newline by a space, even if last char was already a
    space char.
    Then a space char is no more gobbled when a final dot appears at
    end of line.  On the other hand, spacing is now wrong if there
    was extra trailing whitespace characters, but there is no universal
    solution, so do not try to fix broken input.
  * encodings:  Update, thanks to Tomohiro Kubota.
  * po2debconf:  Change default PO directory, it is now `dirname $1`/po 
    so that po2debconf can be called from any directory.
    (Closes: Bug#161371)  Thanks Joey Hess.
  * debconf-gettextize:  If a language has no predefined encoding, rename
    PO file into ll.po.unknown in order not to break further processing.
    (Closes: Bug#161373)  Thanks Joey Hess.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Sep 2002 01:50:25 +0200

po-debconf (0.3.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * po2debconf: print text in the new Field-ll_LL.ENCODING format
    introduced by debconf 1.2.0.
    Old format is still available with the -O flag.
  * po2debconf: -u is the default, and -n prevents conversion to UTF-8
  * debconf-gettextize: automatically determine charset of PO files
  * debconf-gettextize: accept new debconf format in input files.

  Of course all these new features are highly experimental and not
  well tested.

  * debconf-gettextize: do not print localized fields in _templates files

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Sep 2002 22:09:18 +0200

po-debconf (0.2.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Martin Sjogren asked being able to transform his UTF-8 templates
    files into legacy encoding in order to be used by debconf.
    This is achieved with -E flag of po2debconf.  (Closes: #161041)
  * Fix debconf-gettextize usage, it only accepts a single master file.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Sep 2002 22:32:48 +0200

po-debconf (0.2.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Replace 'Encoding: utf-8' by 'Encoding: UTF-8', since this is
    the canonical name in glibc.
  * Add a README file.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Sep 2002 19:02:35 +0200

po-debconf (0.2.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * update intltool scripts for latest CVS.
  * As suggested by Joey Hess, po2debconf supports a new --utf8 flag
    which adds a 'Encoding: utf-8' line and convert all strings into
    utf-8.
  * Add a dependency against libc6 because iconv is needed by this
    new flag.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Sep 2002 20:08:31 +0200

po-debconf (0.2.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Oops, /usr/share/po-debconf/intltool-* scripts were missing.
  * Converted to native Debian package.

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Sep 2002 00:34:08 +0200

po-debconf (0.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Uploads to experimental, procedures for l10n have currently been
    tested by few people only, some feedback from other translators is
    welcome before uploading to unstable.  (Closes: Bug#160284)
  * Initial release

 -- Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Sep 2002 00:06:37 +0200
