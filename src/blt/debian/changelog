blt (2.4z-4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU (needed to build python-tk against tk8.5).
  * Based on the patch made in Ubuntu:
    - Build for tk8.5, drop the tk8.3 build, still keep the build for
      tk8.4. Closes: #473006.
    - debian/control: Drop {tcl,tk}8.3 dependencies, add {tcl,tk}8.5
      dependencies.
    - debian/rules: Do not build the library for Tcl 8.3.
    - debian/hackshlibs: Do not try to mangle 8.3 libraries.
    - Apply patch from Fedora to build with tk8.5.
  * In dh_makeshlibs bump the version to 2.4z-4.1, first version providing
    tk8.5 libs.
  * Fix typos in hiertable and treeview man pages. Closes: #350362, #350363.

blt (2.4z-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dependencies (and build-dependencies) on now-obsolete tcl/tk
    8.0 packages.
  * Added new. up-to-date config.{sub,guess} files (closes: #342393).
  * Added a README.Debian file, and mentioned the lack of "bltwish" (and
    how to cope) in there (closes: #304805).
  * Fixed numerous typos in the man pages, as found and reported by A
    Costa (closes: #310361, #310362, #310363, #310364, #310366, #310367),
    (closes: #310369, #310370, #310372, #310374, #310377, #326522).  Also
    fixed the corresponding typos in the HTML docs.

blt (2.4z-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tighten up -dev package dependency on blt, for extra safety in
    future.
  * Added -D_REENTRANT to CFLAGS for that extra, tasty bit of policy
    compliance.
  * Completely rewrote the package descriptions; they are now shorter,
    more descriptive, and contain far fewer grammar and spelling errors,
    (closes: #204553).
  * Moved the man pages and HTML docs for the BLT commands from the
    blt-dev package to the blt package, where they really belong.  Left
    just the man pages for the BLT C API calls in the blt-dev package.
    Renamed the command man pages to have the extension .3blt (I wanted to
    use .3tcl, but that caused a conflict with the tcllib package).
  * Wrote a handy, but very hackish, script to generate a shlibs.local
    file with the very special dependencies needed by blt.  Among other
    things, the script puts tcl8.4 first on the list of tcl alternatives.
    The script also generates tk dependencies, in the same way, so blt
    finally depends on tk8.x, as it really should have all along
    (closes: #257571, #257572).
  * Changed the blt-demo package to Arch: all, as it only contains scripts
    and images.  Also moved all the scripts to /usr/share so I no longer
    need symlinks to the image directories which had previously been
    moved to /usr/share.
  * Removed the blt-common package, as it's no longer needed.  There's
    only the one BLT package left since blt8.0 was removed.
  * Switched to using the handy $INSTALL_ROOT variable provided by the
    upstream makefiles, which made things much simpler, but required some
    tiny patching in Makefile.in and library/Makefile.in.
  * Did some cleanup of debian/*, removing old, unused cruft.

blt (2.4z-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (closes: #162857).
  * Stripped out support for obsolete 8.2 version of tcl/tk.
  * Moved (most) images to /usr/share to satisfy lintian.
  * Moved treeview bitmaps to blt-common where they can be a little more
    useful (closes: #191646).  Added appropriate conflicts.

  * debian/copyright: Correct URL (closes: #162549).

blt (2.4y-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
      o I do not actually use blt, but I used to and my rather small testset
        seems to work on this package. Happy to receive testing feedback.
      o stubs still not supported upstream
      o dynamic libraries do not have the full dependencies (fixed). Hope I
        understood shared library dependencies correctly and it is the upstream
        maintainer who is wrong rather than me!
      o still use DEBIAN code to support different tcl/tk combinations of
        run-time conditions.
      o still some lintian problems initially with rpath and executables
        (fixed in package).
      o lintian complains that the shlib control file has duplicate
        entries, even though the major numbers are different. For simplicity
        I only show the 8.3 linkages to make lintian happy, but this is
        probably the wrong solution, and is probably a lintian error. But
        to be honest I never understood shlib control function so I do not
        know if I am right or not. If you are having problems with this part
        of blt let me know.
    (closes: #150425)
  * Move the doc-base entries to Apps/Programming, as per the
    advice of Ben Burton <benb@acm.org>
    (closes: #112351)
  * Fails to build on the HURD.
    Somehow I never noticed this email until now, so sorry for the delay
    Anyway, the patch is now added - hope this works out for all the HURD
    users.
    (closes: #143349)
  * A problem with vectors was reported as a bug. Happily this problem does
    not occur with this latest version of BLT.

blt (2.4u-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Problem reported in the shlibs file. I had created this file by hand due
    to problems which existed somewhere but are now long forgotten. I have
    changed the mechanism back to the dh_ approach.
    (closes: #131356)
  * For no strong reason I have removed the circular dependencies from the
    control file. You man now install blt-common on its own if you wish.
    (closes: #128413)
  * Added blt8.0 to the conflicts line of blt, even though blt provides
    blt8.0. I am sure I had this originally but this was against the policy.
    Hope it is ok this time.
    (closes: #132761)
  * Lintian fixes: fixed config/ldconfig issue, removed emacs settings from
    changelog file, removed duplicate relation in blt-dev control. Lintian
    still reports problems with shlibs file. I hope I have got it right this
    time.

blt (2.4u-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Build failure on hppa (at least) -
    This failure was caused by problems in using autoconf, namely the updating
    of config.sub and config.guess. I have added in a build dependency
    for autotools-dev which should solve this problem, and a change to make
    use of this in the rules file.
    Other architectures should not notice any changes.

blt (2.4u-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * The new version of debhelper now considers substvars to be an "internal"
    file, even though it is mentioned explicitly in the man pages for the
    command. Rather than reassign this to debhelper and get into a discusion
    concerning backward compatibility, I have engineered a work-around for the
    problem completely avoiding substvars, but instead accessing the
    DEBIAN/control file directly. It seems to work... and in fact was probably
    a good thing as I detected an error in the dependencies while poking around
    in the control file which is also fixed as a side-effect. Of course what
    I am doing is probably a Bad Thing (TM) anyway, but until I am caught...

  * Forgot ALL the include files in blt8.0-dev.
  * Remove configure.old when producing a source diff. Saves
    tons of space in the diff file.
  * Had to add some hacks to ths shlib creation algorithm to prevent
    lintian moaning that there were duplicate entries. I am not
    100% certain that my fix is proper shlib format information, so
    if you have subsequent problems working out automatic shlib
    dependences let me know.

blt (2.4u-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * removed blt8.0 from the package collection. The various library
    dependencies are handled automatically by BLT now.
  * New upstream release 2.4u.
    (closes: #69015)
  * moods needs a BLT compatible with tk8.3 (a critical bug),
    so I need to release
    a new version. This is also a new upstream version of BLT. It promices
    eventual support of tcl stubs, which will allow blt to be compatible to
    any version of tcl beyond 8.3 without having to have separate libraries.
    In the meantime we will just have to use the script provided for Debian
    which dynamically loads in the correct version at run-time.
    This is a complicated package so please test this on your own applications.
    (closes: #89520)
  * BLT upstream support for stubs is comming soon (next release apparently),
    but will apparently be for tcl8.3 and above. The problem requiring
    stub support is tackled in this release in a different way, and stubs will
    be added afterwards.

blt (2.4o-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstead version
  * Some updates got wrongly inserted into an older version of blt. This
    release brings everything up to date.
  * Added in support for a tcl/tk 8.3 library build. However, blt does not
    work with 8.3 yet, and will simply generate a library error at run-time.
    However, this addition will at least prevent blt programs core-dumping due to
    accidentally using 8.3.

    fall over. I am not sure if this fix will solve everything,  but it

blt (2.4l-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * blt-dev is still dependent on tk8.0-dev and tcl8.0-dev. This should have
    been tk8.2-dev and tcl8.2-dev. This version now uses package names
    blt8.0 and blt8.0-dev, so these packages no longer are replaced by
    blt and blt-dev.
  * Changed to debhelper from debstd (the rules file was just getting too
    complicated to understand).
  * added three new packages, blt-common, blt8.0 and blt8.0-dev.
    This was necessary as I have two conflicting requirements from
    package users
      - Link to the latest tk/tcl libraries (eg 8.2)
      - have a stable version of the blt library (eg link to tk/tcl 8.0)
    Linking to 8.2 has resulted in a much poorer blt environment filled
    with unexplained runtime bugs. Thus, blt8.0 and blt8.0-dev are
    identical to blt and blt-dev, but are linked to tk/tcl 8.0. The new
    packages are linked to the latest tk/tcl versions.
    blt8.0-dev conflicts with blt-dev. The common parts of packages
    blt8.0 and blt have been split out into blt-common. This makes for quite
    a lot of packages for blt... Sorry about that.

    If reliability is your keyword, change alternatives so that you always
    use wish8.0 and tclsh8.0 by default, and make sure you have tk/tcl8.0
    runtime libraries.

    Note that for library naming restrictions, libBLT.2.4.so.8.2 is linked
    with the latest tcl/tk libraries, while libBLT.2.4.so.8.0 is always linked
    to a stable tcl/tk 8.0 where everything seems to work. For development,
    libBLT8.0.so is a link to the blt linked to tk8.0, and libBLT8.2.so for
    tk8.2.
    (closes: #46920)
  * changed pkgIndex to select dynamically either blt for tk8.2 or 8.0
    depending on which wish was in use. Thus making the new library naming
    scheme invisible for scripts.
  * this package must have tk8.0, tk8.2, tcl8.0, tcl8.2, tk8.2-dev, tcl8.2-dev
    installed to build from source. tk8.0-dev and tcl8.0-dev are not required,
    and are instead emulated internally.

blt8.0 (2.4f-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Due to complexities in managing the possibility of both blt4.2 and blt8.0
    being present simultaneously, I have changed the blt8.0 approach so that
    only blt8.0+ will provide BLT2.4f and beyond. Hopefully, blt4.2 will
    quietly be dropped. This makes the control file simpler.
  * David Engel has made some comments which have been encorporated in this
    release:
       o only blt8.0 will use libBLT.so.2.4 and beyond.
       o the /usr/lib/blt2.4 directory is needed in blt8.0, although
         the demo scripts remain in blt8.0-dev
       o bltwish is provided as both bltwish and bltwish2.4, for consistency
         with other distributions.
