  * debian/rules:
    - Really install NEWS.Debian as documentation.
  * debian/patches:
    - 220-nobs-when-stdout-is-a-tty.patch: deleted, useless now, since
      backspaces are not produced at all.
    - 400-remove-builtin-http-support.patch: refreshed. 
    - 500-utf8-support.patch: refreshed.
    - 510-utf8-implies-nobs.patch: deleted, useless now.
    - New 510-disable-backspaces.patch: disable backspaces because parser
      cannot produce them rightly in multi-byte sequences now.
    - 611-recognize-input-encoding.patch: 
      - Corrected to don't produce error if '-nometa' option was not supplied
        and input html doesn't contain valid 'meta http-equiv' tag.
      - Corrected to don't display debug info twicely (if -debug-parser or
        -debug-scanner was supplied).
      - Corrected: now parser always processes UTF-8 text, needed for proper
        output recoding.

      - Close input stream directly after read, not after the processing.
      - Correctly mark the end of converted sequence.

    - Added correct input encoding cases to 'Input recoding' section.
    - Added 'Backspaces' section.
    - Added 'Output recoding' section.
  * debian/html2text.1:
    - Mentioned that Debian version of html2text doesn't produce backspaces,
      so '-nobs' does nothing.
    - Added paragraph about input/output recoding.
  * debian/NEWS.Debian:
    - Corrected news for 1.3.2a-9.
  * debian/control:
    - Renewed long description.
