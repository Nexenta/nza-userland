swi-prolog (5.6.63-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FTBFS on architectures other than i386 and amd64 (Closes: #510409)
    - Add 05_fix_java_lib_paths.dpatch to fix Java include directory for
      architectures that have OpenJDK but the Autoconf fragment is new enough
      to cater for it.
    - Don't Build-Depend on openjdk-6-jre on arm and hppa.
    - Expand "Architecture: any" and remove arm and hppa.

swi-prolog (5.6.59-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release - "mostly a bugfix release, fixing GC and HTTP issues
    from 5.6.56":
    - Garbage collection fixes:
      + Avoid crash on recursive GC signalling
      + Add support for A_MPZ in life-gc walker (crasher)
      + Call signal handlers at a safe place whilst backtracking.
      + Fix possible crash of profiler on GC.
      + Misc. GC fixes
    - HTTP fixes:
      + http_read_request/3 throws error on illegal request and 
        http_wrapper/5.
      + http_open/3 now raises an error if the URL is not well-formed
        instead of failing silently.
    - Other fixes:
      + Fix possible crash in copy_term/2 etc. on 32-bit systems.
      + Avoid import messages from module user in saved states.
    - New features:

      + zcompare/3, analogous to compare/3 for FD variables.
      + constraint element/3, analogous to nth/1.
  * Build CHR on arm and armel again after GC fixes (disabled in 5.6.58-2).

swi-prolog (5.6.58-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix regression when moving from dh_movefiles to dh_install. dh_install
    only copies the specifies files whilst dh_movefiles moves them - this was
    resulting in the contents of the binary "swi-prolog" package being
    duplicated inside "swi-prolog-xpce", causing file conflicts at
    installation. (Closes: #492364)
  * Don't build the CHR package on arm and armel to prevent FTBFS on these
    archictures.
  * Add 04_fix_hyphens_being_used_as_minus_signs_in_manpages.dpatch to fix
    hyphen issues in manpages.
  * Build-Depend on debhelper (>= 5) instead of (>= 5.0.0).
  * Add "no-symbols-control-file" override to the shared-library related
    lintian overrides.
  * Actually remove dbuild ".pwd" file - was not being deleted since
    5.6.47-1 or so.

swi-prolog (5.6.58-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Fix GCC flag handling as SWI-Prolog prefers COFLAGS over CFLAGS:
    - Unset CFLAGS to allow upstream build system to select optimisations.
    - Should fix FTBFS on arm as -O0 is passed properly (introduced in
      5.6.49-1).
  * Fix typo ("polution" -> "pollution") in README.Debian.
  * Replace calls to `pwd` in debian/rules with $(CURDIR).
  * Move from dh_movefiles to dh_install.

swi-prolog (5.6.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Make '/usr/bin/swipl' a symlink again. This was a regression introduced
    by my fix to #456261 which was preventing scripts to use a shebang line
    pointing to swipl. Passing the environment variable PL to configure sets
    the target binary name in a far more less brittle manner. (Closes: #462646)
  * Remove deprecated swiprolog binary and associated manpage. This name was
    deprecated in 2001 and does not support scripting.
  * Add missing ${shlibs:Depends} to swi-prolog-http.
  * Cleanup debian/rules.

      of a symlink (Closes: #456261)
  * Delete empty directories (spotted by lintian)
  * Tidy (unfixed) Lintian "image-file-in-usr-lib" overrides.
  * Update Standards-Version: to 3.7.3.

  * Move from XS-Vcs-* to Vcs-*.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} for all binaries.
  * Include dpatch.make instead of re-implementing patch/unpatch targets.
  * Remove RPATH from pl2xpce.so in install target (spotted by lintian)
  * Fix FTBFS on ARM.
  * Rename Vcs-Browse -> Vcs-Browser. (Thanks to Daniel Baumann)
