Description: Development libraries, header files and docs for libevent
 Contains the header files, documentation, examples and static libraries 
 for use in developing applications that use the libevent library.
 .
 The libevent library is an asynchronous event notification library
 that provides a mechanish to execute a callback function when a specific
 event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.

Package: libevent-1.4-2
Section: libs
Priority: standard
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: An asynchronous event notification library
 The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
 when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
 has been reached.
 .
 libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 For backward compatibility and to transition to libevent_core only or
 libevent_core and libevent_extra, the libevent source package builds
 the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and
 libevent_extra.

Package: libevent-core-1.4-2
Section: libs
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: An asynchronous event notification library (core)
 The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
 when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
 has been reached.
 .
 libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 The libevent_core library includes event loops, timers, buffer code,
 and various small compatibility functions.
 .
 If you're writing software that only uses libevent's event loop, you
 should link against only the libevent_core library.

Package: libevent-extra-1.4-2
Section: libs
Priority: optional
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libevent-core-1.4-2 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: An asynchronous event notification library (extra)
 The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
 when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
 has been reached.
 .
 libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 The libevent_extra library includes code for HTTP, DNS, RPC, and so
 on.
 .
 If you're writing software that uses libevent's protocol support, you
 need to link libevent_core and libevent_extra as well.
