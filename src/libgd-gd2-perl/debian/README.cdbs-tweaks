CDBS tweak
==========

CDBS is great. In some corner cases, however, some parts of CDBS
sometimes needs a few tweaks to work optimally.

This is a collection of such tweaks. The goal is for these tweaks to be
absorbed into upstream CDBS. We just haven't found time yet to discuss
them at the CDBS developers' mailinglist. And possible we do not all
agree that the tweaks are so great - therefore this "staging area".

If you found this file below debian/ subdir in a source package, most
probably only a subset of the below mentioned tweaks are relevant and
have been shipped with the package. The repository of all these tweaks
is here: svn://svn.debian.org/build-common/people/js/overlay/

Web access: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/build-common/people/js/overlay/



New buildinfo rule
------------------

See package description for "buildinfo" for more info.



Improved support for multiple compilations

Support multiple build flavors in makefile and autotools classes.



Various improvements to python-distutils class
----------------------------------------------

Use full path to Python interpreter (Python Policy section 1.3.2).

Add CDBS_BUILD_DEPENDS to old policy method.

Fix CDBS_BUILD_DEPENDS in new policy methods to only depend on debhelper
when actually used.

Fix DEB_PYTHON_SIMPLE_PACKAGES sometimes installed twice (and only one
of them honouring DEB_PYTHON_COMPILE_VERSION).

Unify install path using new DEB_PYTHON_DESTDIR.

Quote install path.



New python-autotools class
--------------------------

Handle autotools-based Python packaging.



New python-sugar class

Handle packaging of Sugar activities.



New copyright-check rule
------------------------

Refuse to build if the source is found to contain different copyright

New kernelpatches rule
----------------------

Small wrapper around dh-kpatches, taking care of build-dependencies too.



New routines for handling upstream tarball
------------------------------------------

Rules and variables to help downloading, validating and repackaging
upstream tarball.

Implements the rules print-version and get-orig-source commonly used
for group-maintained packages with Debian-specific patches maintained in
SVN or some other VCS, and automated fetching virgin upstream tarball
(possibly massaged after download e.g. to strip non-DFSG material).



Support for custom BTS info
---------------------------

Include BTS control info found in debian/*.bts files, or alternatively
redirect bug reports to the email address defined in DEB_BTS_EMAIL.



New dict class
--------------

Rules for packaging ispell, aspell, myspell and wordlist dictionaries.
