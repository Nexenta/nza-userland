Description: Generic library support script
 This is GNU libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
 the complexity of generating special library types (such as shared
 libraries) behind a consistent interface.  To use libtool, add the
 new generic library building commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in,
 or Makefile.am.  See the documentation for details.  Libtool supports
 building static libraries on all platforms.
 .
 Libtool supports generation of C, C++, Fortran and Java libraries.

Description: A system independent dlopen wrapper for GNU libtool
 This package contains the run-time libltdl library.
 .
 A small library that aims at hiding the various difficulties of
 dlopening libraries from programmers.  It is a system independent
 dlopen wrapper for GNU libtool.
 .
 It supports the following dlopen interfaces:
   * dlopen (Solaris, Linux and various BSD flavors)
   * shl_load (HP-UX)
   * LoadLibrary (Win16 and Win32)
   * load_add_on (BeOS)
   * GNU DLD (emulates dynamic linking for static libraries)
   * libtool's dlpreopen
