vim-scripts (20091011) unstable; urgency=low

  * The supertab plugin has made various backwards-incompatible changes to its
    options.
    - g:SuperTabRetainCompletionType is now g:SuperTabRetainCompletionDuration
      and accepts one of 'none', 'insert', or 'session'.
    - new setting g:SuperTabCompletionContexts defines which context completion
      functions are consulted.
    - g:SuperTabDefaultCompletionTypeDiscovery is now
      g:SuperTabContextDiscoverDiscovery and requires that
      g:SuperTabContextDefaultCompletionType is set to 'context' and that
      's:ContextDiscover' is in your g:SuperTabCompletionContexts list

vim-scripts (7.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * NERD Commenter rename and mapleader changes.

    NERD Commenter upstream has renamed the .vim filename from
    NERD_comments.vim to NERD_commenter.vim, you need to re-enable the script
    in your system: "vim-addons install nerd-commenter" should to the trick if
    you already changed to the new way of managing vim addons (see the
    vim-addon-manager package for more info).

    In addition to that, the leader key for all NERD Commenter mapping has
    been changed upstream from '\' to ',', to avoid key clashes with the
    popular vcscommand plugin. See ":help NERDMapleader" if you want to have
    back the old behaviour.

vim-scripts (7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The plugins CVSCommand.vim and SVNCommand.vim has been merged into a
    single plugin, namely VCSCommand.vim. As a consequence, almost all
    commands formerly named CVSxxx have been renamed to VCSxxx.
    
    See /usr/share/doc/vim-scripts/CHANGES.CVSCommand.txt for details.
