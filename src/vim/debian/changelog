  * Stop removing vimspell, vim132, and maze from the runtime tools/
    directory.  The issues leading to their removal should be addressed
    instead of removing them from the package.
    - vimspell - The tempfile vulnerability (CAN-2005-0069) has been fixed
      upstream for some time now.
    - vim132 - Add lintian overrides for "csh is harmful" and not having a
      Depends/Recommends/Suggests on tcsh | csh.  This is the only file in the
      package that would use the shell and its an example script.
    - maze - maze.c doesn't work properly and its README suggests this may be
      the case on newer compilers and to use mazeansi.c, which does work.

  * Switch to copyright from vim 6.1BETA which is fully GPL compatible
  * More upstream patches:
    + 6.0.227: The RISC OS port has several problems.
    + 6.0.228: After putting text in Visual mode the '] mark is not at
      the end of the put text. Undo doesn't work properly when putting
      a word into a Visual selection that spans more than one line.
    + 6.0.229: Multi-byte: With 'm' in 'formatoptions', formatting
      doesn't break at a multi-byte char followed by an ASCII char,
      and the other way around. When joining lines a space is inserted
      between multi-byte characters, which is not always wanted.
    + 6.0.230: The ":" used as a motion after an operator is exclusive,
      but sometimes it should be inclusive.
    + 6.0.231: "gd" and "gD" don't work when the variable matches in a
      comment just above the match to be found.
    + 6.0.232: "vim --version" prints on stderr while "vim --help" prints
      on stdout.
    + 6.0.233: "\1\{,8}" in a regexp is not allowed, but it should work,
      because there is an upper limit.
    + 6.0.234: It's not easy to set the cursor position without modifying
      marks.
    + 6.0.235: When writing a file and renaming the original file to make
      the backup, permissions could change when setting the owner.
    + 6.0.236: ":edit" without argument should move cursor to line 1 in
      Vi compatible mode.
    + 6.0.237: In a C file, using the filetype plugin, re-indenting a
      comment with two spaces after the middle "*" doesn't align properly.
    + 6.0.238: Using a ":subsitute" command with a substitute() call in
      the substitution expression causes errors.
    + 6.0.239: Using "A" to append after a Visually selected block which
      is after the end of the line, spaces are inserted in the wrong line
      and other unexpected effects.
    + 6.0.240: Win32: building with Python 2.2 doesn't work.
    + 6.0.241: Win32: Expanding the old value of an option that is a path
      that starts with a backslash, an extra backslash is inserted.
    + 6.0.242: GUI: On a system with an Exceed X server sometimes get a
      "Bad Window" error.
    + 6.0.243: Unix: "vim --version" outputs a NL before the last line
      instead of after it.
    + 6.0.244: Multi-byte: Problems with (illegal) UTF-8 characters in
      menu and file name (e.g., icon text, status line).
    + 6.0.245: After using a color scheme, setting the 'background'
      option might not work.
    + 6.0.246: ":echomsg" didn't use the highlighting set by
      ":echohl". (Gary Holloway)
    + 6.0.247: GTK GUI: Can't use gvim in a kpart widget.
    + 6.0.248: When using compressed help files and 'encoding' isn't
      "latin1", Vim converts the help file before decompressing.
    + 6.0.249: "vim -t edit -c 'sta ex_help'" doesn't move cursor to
      edit().
    + 6.0.250: Macintosh: Various problems when compiling.
    + 6.0.251: Macintosh: menu shortcuts are not very clear.
    + 6.0.252: When a user function was defined with "abort", an error that
      is not inside if/endif or while/endwhile doesn't abort the function.
    + 6.0.253: When 'insertmode' is set, after "<C-O>:edit file" the next
      <C-O> doesn't work. (Benji Fisher) <C-L> has the same problem.
    + 6.0.254: Borland C++ 5.5: Checking for stack overflow doesn't work
      correctly. Matters when using a complicated regexp.
    + 6.0.255: Win32: ACL support doesn't work well on Samba drives.
    + 6.0.256: Win32: ":highlight Comment guifg=asdf" does not give an
      error message. (Randall W. Morris) Also for other systems.
    + 6.0.257: Win32: When 'mousefocus' is set and there is a BufRead
      autocommand, after the dialog for permissions changed outside of Vim:
      'mousefocus' stops working.
    + 6.0.258: When 'scrolloff' is 999 and there are folds, the text
      can jump up and down when moving the cursor down near the end of
      the file.
    + 6.0.259: MS-DOS: after editing the command line the cursor shape
      may remain like in Insert mode.
    + 6.0.260: GUI: May crash while starting up when giving an error
      message for missing color.
    + 6.0.261: nr2char() and char2nr() don't work with multi-byte
      characters.
    + 6.0.262: Win32: IME doesn't work properly. OnImeComposition()
      isn't used at all.
    + 6.0.263: GTK: When a dialog is closed by the window manager,
      Vim hangs.
    + 6.0.264: The amount of virtual memory is used to initialize
      'maxmemtot', which may be much more than the amount of physical
      memory, resulting in a lot of swapping.
    + 6.0.265: Win32: Using backspace while 'fkmap' is set causes a crash.
    + 6.0.266: The rename() function deletes the file if the old and the
      new name are the same.
    + 6.0.267: UTF-8: Although 'isprint' says a character is printable,
      utf_char2cells() still considers it unprintable.
    + 6.0.268: Win32: ACL check crashes when using forward slash in
      file name.
    + 6.0.269: Unprintable characters in a file name may cause problems
      when using the 'statusline' option or when 'buftype' is "nofile".
    + 6.0.270: A tab causes UTF-8 text to be displayed in the wrong
      position.

      on a file name gives error messages.

      it is expanded again. Windows: ":edit \[abc]" could never edit the file
      "[abc]".

    + 6.0.216: After reloading a file, displayed in another window than the
      current one, which was changed outside of Vim the part of the file around

      original cursor position when entering the window again.
    + 6.0.217: When getting help from a help file that was used before, an
      empty unlisted buffer remains in the buffer list.
    + 6.0.218: With explorer plugin: "vim -o filename dirname" doesn't load the

    + 6.0.147: It's not easy to mark a Vim version as being modified. The

      highlighted for diff highlighting.
    + 6.0.060: Motif: When the tooltip is to be popped up, Vim crashes.

 -- Stuart Lamble <lamble@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>  Tue, 19 Nov 1996 21:51:28 +1100

vim (4.5-3) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Last release without GUI support - I've finally downloaded the 3.2 .deb
    files.
  * added view and view.1.gz to /etc/alternatives.
  * changed CFLAGS to compile with -g -O2 (instead of -g -O)
  * modified the default vimrc to allow full read/writing of text files
    compressed with gzip.
  * added "version 4.0" to the default vimrc (so much for getting people
    to RTFM :-)
  * Ray Dassen sent me some email about not capturing stderr by default;
    after thinking about it, I decided against this. It's useful for
    programmers when compiling from within vim, and besides, it's easy to
    configure (look at the shellredir setting :)

vim (4.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * merged in patches from Bram into both source trees (the new version is

    it's the same as the ctags found elsewhere in the distribution.
  * fixed a small typo in the copyright: referred to 4.4 instead of 4.5.
    Oops. :)

vim (4.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

    modified the installed version to direct help to those gzipped docs.
  * added an empty gvimrc to /etc
  * added a vimrc capable of reading the gzipped docs

vim (4.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version (considered beta, but seems pretty stable to
    me.)
  * modified Makefile to allow for installation to .../debian/tmp rather
    than /usr/ (otherwise, man pages would have been sorta fubar..)
  * redirected global vimrc/gvimrc to /etc
  * modified configure to look for termcap _last_, ncurses first
    (upstream version: termcap, then ncurses.)
  * added a "Provides: editor" (don't know if this is still current, but
    it won't hurt if it isn't.)
