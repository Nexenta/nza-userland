    - 014: Bash mishandles word splitting under certain circumstances
      when IFS is null (IFS=).  Constructs affected include ${param/pat/sub}
      and others when expanding arrays (array[@]).
    - 015: Under certain circumstances, when using FIFOs for process
      substitution, bash fails to unlink the FIFOs.  This leaves open
      file descriptors that can cause the shell to hang and litters
      the file system.
