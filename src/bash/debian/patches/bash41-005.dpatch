# DP: bash-4.1 upstream patch 005

			     BASH PATCH REPORT
			     =================

Bash-Release:	4.1
Patch-ID:	bash41-005

Bug-Reported-by:	werner@suse.de
Bug-Reference-ID:	<201002251238.o1PCcYcg016893@boole.suse.de>
Bug-Reference-URL:	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2010-02/msg00132.html

Bug-Description:

When the `read' builtin times out after the timeout specified with -t is
exceeded, it does not reset the flags that tell signal handlers to process
signals immediately instead of deferring their handling.  This can result
in unsafe functions being called from signal handlers, which can cause bash
to hang or dump core.

Patch (apply with `patch -p0'):
