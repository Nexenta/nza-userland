memcached (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, primarily bugfixes, some of them critical, hence
    the urgency:
    - Reject keys larger than 250 bytes in the binary protocol.
    - Bounds checking on stats cachedump.
    - Binary protocol set+cas wasn't returning a new cas ID.
    - Binary quitq didn't actually close the connection
    - Slab boundary checking cleanup (bad logic in unreachable code)
    - Get hit memory optimizations
    - Disallow -t options that cause the server to not work
    - Killed off incomplete slab rebalance feature.
  * debian/patches:
    - 01_init_script_compliant_with_LSB.patch: Remade as upstream applied a
      whitespace cleanup script that broke the patch.
    - 02_manpage_additions.patch: Added missing parameters to the memcached
      manpage.
  * Removed TODO from debian/docs.

memcached (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #484301, #537239):
    - New binary protocol, supporting CAS (compare-and-swap).
    - Non-threaded version is no longer possible, you just choose to run 1
      thread to have similar behaviour.
    - Lots of performance bottlenecks fixed (connection starvation,
      contention, disabling of CAS, locks for hash table expansion...).
    - Lots of new stats.  Main change is that stats now are per-slab where
      possible.
    - Code cleanup, lots of bugs fixed, added tests, enhanced documentation.

memcached (1.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, urgency=high because of two critical bugs prior
    to this release:
    - In 1.2.7 under multithreaded mode, memcached would never restart
      accepting connections after hitting the maximum connection limit.
    - Remove 'stats maps' command, as it is a potential information leak,
      usable if versions prior to 1.2.8 ever have buffer overflows discovered
      (CVE-2009-1494).  Closes: #526554.
    - Make -b command (setting the TCP listen backlog) actually work.
  * debian/rules: Removed obsolete --disable-static.
