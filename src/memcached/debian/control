Description: A high-performance memory object caching system
 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com, 
 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1 
 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers. 
 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page 
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the 
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl 
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.
