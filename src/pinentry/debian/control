Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users working
 in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling packages
 that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If you
 install any of the latter packages then this package is not necessary
 because the sibling packages automatically fall back to text mode if
 X is not active.

# This package contains the documentation for the pinentry packages,
# a suite of programs that allow secure entry of PINs or pass phrases.
# If you have one of the pinentry packages installed then you may want
# to install this package as well, but the documentation mostly concerns
# the internal protocol and is therefore not necessary for the casual
# user.
