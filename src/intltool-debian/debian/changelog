intltool-debian (0.35.0+20060710) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sync CVS: intltool 2006/07/10.

  * intltool-extract: Fix numbering of template fields.  Closes: #377354
    Thanks Florentin Duneau for the report and Thomas Huriaux for the patch.

intltool-debian (0.34.2+20060621) unstable; urgency=low

  * intltool-extract: Fields for the first template are now numbered from
    1001, for the 2nd template from 2001 and so forth.  All references are
    written into the POT file, which allows podebconf-display-po to handle
    strings which appear several times in templates.  Closes: #374463
    Thanks Yuri Kozlov for the report and Thomas Huriaux for the fix.
    This change will also let podebconf-display-po do a better job when
    recreating original templates file, in particular it will be able to
    handle cases when other fields follow Description, as has been discussed
    in #366227.

intltool-debian (0.34.2+20060512) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sync CVS: intltool 2006/05/12.

  * intltool-extract: Use C++ comments '//' instead of C comments '/*...*/'
    to allow '*/' in comments.  Closes: #366450  Thanks Christian Perrier

  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version: 3.7.2, no changes are needed.

  * debian/control: As told by lintian, replace Build-Depends-Indep: debhelper
    by Build-Depends: debhelper because debhelper programs are run by the
    clean target.

intltool-debian (0.34.2+20060415) unstable; urgency=low

  * intltool-update: This program called /usr/bin/file to determine file
    encoding.  It is useless in intltool-debian, so this call is dropped
    indtead of adding an unnecessary dependency.  Closes: #362814
    Thanks Marc Haber

intltool-debian (0.34.2+20060322) unstable; urgency=low

  * intltool-merge: Under some special circumstances, an English field
    composed of several paragraphs may contain an empty string.  Of course
    this empty string has no translation, and thus the whole paragraph is
    untranslated.  A better approach is to assume that an empty string
    has an empty translation.  Closes: #357948  Thanks Colin Watson
  * Update to intltool 0.34.2; there is no change in handling of
    RFC822 files.

intltool-debian (0.34.1+20060220) unstable; urgency=low

  * intltool-merge: Do not reformat translated templates.  This will produce
    very long lines, but this is already the case with locale or keyboard
    choosers, so there should be no problem with (c)debconf.

  * intltool-merge: Comments are now properly discarded.

  * Comments in the form '#flag:' are interpreted by intltool-extract and
    intltool-merge.  They are helpful when a translatable field is composed
    of several strings.  Recognized keywords are:
      - #flag:translate: Write only the specified strings into PO files.
      - #flag:comment: Comments can be defined for each individual string.
      - #flag:partial: This flag prints translated strings even if they are
        not fully translated.
  * See full documentation in po-debconf(7).
  * Slightly modify intltool-merge and intltool-extract so that inner routines
    are more similar and thus less error prone.

  * Add intltool authors into debian/copyright.

intltool-debian (0.34.1+20050828) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to intltool 0.34.1; there is no change in handling of
    RFC822 files.
  * intltool-merge: When a localized short description contains a newline,
    it is replaced by a space and a warning is reported.  Closes: #308581
    Thanks Christian Perrier.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version: 3.6.2

intltool-debian (0.30+20040213) unstable; urgency=low

  * intltool-extract:  A template without translatable fields caused
    bogus comments in PO files, the next template had a wrong type.
    Closes: #260086  Thanks Pierre Machard.

intltool-debian (0.30+20040212) unstable; urgency=low

  * Intltool-merge uses Text::Wrap to word-wrap translated templates.
    But when a long line begins with a space and has many non-space
    characters, it is split.  The resulting template is then wrongly
    formatted by debconf.  The current fix is to detect such lines
    and put them together.  Closes: #236228
    In fact there seems to be no reason to reformat the full templates
    file, but this change is somewhat drastic and care must be taken.
  * Handle escaped commas in __Choices fields.  Those escapes are a
    cdebconf extension, so until it is accepted by debconf, this new
    feature won't be documented.  Bugreport and patch sent by
    Matt Kraai, thanks.  Closes: #241188

intltool-debian (0.30+20040211) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sync CVS: intltool 2004/02/11.
  * intltool-merge:  When a Template line has a comment just above, it was
    concatenated with the previous template.  Closes: #232070

intltool-debian (0.27.2+20031023) unstable; urgency=low

  * intltool-extract:  In order to have po-debconf put templates
    type as a comment in PO files, this script detects if the
    INTLTOOL_DEBIAN_TYPE environment variable is set and equal
    to 'po-debconf'.  This is a dirty hack until a better solution
    is found via command-line options.
  * intltool-extract:  Change order of automatic comments in PO files,
    they previously looked like
      #. Comments extracted from source files
      #. Description
    and now
      #. Type: select
      #. Description
      #. Comments extracted from source files
    Author comments are the most important part, so put it near English
    text to catch translators' attention.

intltool-debian (0.27.2+20031003) unstable; urgency=low

  * intltool-merge:  If a comment line did contain a colon without
    any space character before it, the line was not removed.

intltool-debian (0.27.2+20030930) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: intltool 0.27.2
  * Upstream release handles non-ASCII msgids, but this feature is disabled
    until sarge is released to ensure that gettext 0.12 is available.
  * Recognize comments in rfc822deb format, i.e. lines beginning with
    a hash sign are put as comments in PO files.
    Such lines were already discarded by intltool-merge, except when
    they contain a colon.  In this version, they are always discarded.
  * Bump Standards-Version: 3.6.1

  * intltool-update:  Comment lines are not taken into account when
    determining if the .pot file has changed.

intltool-debian (0.26+20030523) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: intltool 0.26
  * intltool-update:  When only POT-Creation-Date has changed in the
    .pot file, this file is not updated.

intltool-debian (0.25+20030419) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial public release
  * This is a rearrangement of the po-debconf package needed so
    that other packages managing RFC822 compliant files can use
    features similar to those provided by po-debconf.
    (Closes: #171377)
  * This package contains the modified intltool scripts, previously
    shipped in /usr/share/po-debconf, and now in /usr/share/intltool-debian.
  * Po-debconf will depend on this package when it enters Debian.
  * Changes are reported upstream, so intltool and intltool-debian
    should converge; as intltool-debian is still moving, having
    a separate package helps making quick fixes without breaking
    GNOME packages.
