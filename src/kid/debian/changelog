kid (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Updated watch file to really detect new upstream version.
  * Use python-support to support all available python versions with a single
    package. Thus removes python2.{3,4}-kid packages.
  * Manually rename the egg-info directory to make it clearer that the egg
    is available to all python versions.
  * Since python-elementtree does provide only support for python2.3 right
    now, put python2.4-elementtree in Recommends so that 2.4 users (many!)
    have a chance to notice that they will need it. It also means that
    an application package using python2.4 and kid will have to explicitely
    depends on python2.4-elementtree along with python-kid to make sure that
    it will work.
  * Versioned depend on python-elementtree to be sure that the package has egg
    support and that /usr/bin/kid will work.

kid (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Packages is maintained within the python-modules team. Add myself and
    the team to the Uploaders field.
  * New upstream release. Closes: #359012
  * Create 3 packages python2.3-kid, python2.4-kid, and python-kid depending
    on python2.3-kid and providing the 2 binaries with their manpages.
    Closes: #346111
  * Make python2.3-kid and python-kid replaces the old "kid" package.
  * Make python-kid provides kid to ease the upgrade from the old package
    name. And conflicts on it so that it gets removed.
  * Use setuptools now to install the package so that we can install the egg
    meta-data and make them available to the users. That's why we
    build-depends on python-setuptools (>= 0.6a9).
