GNU Autoconf

This package is derived from sources obtained at:
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf

The Autoconf upstream tarball has been modified by removing most of
the Texinfo documentation.  This is because it is subject to the GNU
Free Documentation License (FDL), which Debian regards as non-free
when invariant sections, such as the front-cover and back-cover texts
in the Autoconf, are included.

Packaged originally by Mark Eichin <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>.
Currently maintained by Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>.

Changes for packaging are licensed under the GNU GPL.

Licensing

Autoconf is released under the General Public License version 3 (GPLv3+).
Additionally, Autoconf includes a licensing exception in some of its
source files; see the respective copyright notices for how your
project is impacted by including scripts generated by Autoconf, and the
COPYING.EXCEPTION file for the exception in terms of the Additional
Permissions as described in section 7 of GPLv3.

For more licensing information, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html> and
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/exceptions.html>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The license exception, which the copyright notice above notes as
appying to some Autoconf source file, is the following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION
                       Version 3.0, 18 August 2009

 Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU
General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3").  It applies to a given
file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file
stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's
typical output under terms of the recipient's choice (including
proprietary).

0. Definitions

"Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf
that is a covered work under this License.

"Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of
its Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not
from its input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and
non-tracing output.

"Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3.  However, if
by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you
received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then
you void this Exception for the resulting covered work.  If you convey
that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance
with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.

2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption
that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of
the license of Autoconf.

Authors of GNU Autoconf.

Autoconf was originally written by David MacKenzie, with help from
Fran√ßois Pinard, Karl Berry, Richard Pixley, Ian Lance Taylor, Roland
McGrath, Noah Friedman, david d zuhn, and many others.

Ben Elliston next took over the maintenance, facing a huge Autoconf
backlog that had been piling up since the departure of David.  Other
maintainers have included Akim Demaille, Jim Meyering, Alexandre
Oliva, and Tom Tromey, with plenty of contributions from Lars J. Aas,
Mo DeJong, Steven G. Johnson, Matthew D. Langston, Pavel Roskin.

Today, the primary maintainers are Paul Eggert and Eric Blake, with
help from Ralf Wildenhues, Stepan Kasal, and Benoit Sigoure.  Many
other people have contributed, as listed in the THANKS file.

The following contributors have warranted legal paper exchanges with
the Free Software Foundation for their contributions to GNU Autoconf.
This list results from searching for AUTOCONF in the file
/gd/gnuorg/copyright.list on the fencepost.gnu.org machine.
