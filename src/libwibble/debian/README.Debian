This package provides only a static library, compiled with -fPIC.

This is because the library consists mostly of templates, and we are not in a
position of guaranteeing ABI stability over upgrades.

The library code may, however, be used in code with bindings to various
scripting languages, as is the case with libept or libbuffy.  Since most
scripting languages (like Perl or Python) need bindings in form of .so
libraries, we need to compile wibble with -fPIC.
