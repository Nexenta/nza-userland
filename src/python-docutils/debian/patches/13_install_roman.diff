Subject: [PATCH] Force roman.py to be installed even if it's already installed

Upstream treats this copy of roman.py as a convenience copy, but Debian
doesn't ship roman.py any other way, so we treat this as the canonical
way to get it.

Creating Debian packages should be deterministic, and we don't want to
have to build-conflict on ourselves.
