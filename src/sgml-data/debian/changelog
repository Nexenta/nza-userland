  * QAML DTD: updated to 2.4; include the QAML FAQ as a QAML example
  * sgml.catalog:
    - add HTML Latin1 and Symbol entity compatability FPIs, as recommended
      by ISO/IEC 15445:2000
    - bump HTML DOCTYPE to HTML v4.01 rather than 4.0, since HTML 4.01 is
      promoted as a recommendation
    - provide the following FPIs based on state of W3C recommendations:
      . "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4//EN" -- HTML 4.01
      . "-//W3C//DTD XHTML//EN"  -- XHTML 1.0
      . "-//W3C//DTD HTML//EN"   -- XHTML 1.0
    - re-organize and improve the commenting
    - fix DTDDECL for QAML
  * debian/control: add suggests for doc-html-w3, which contains most of
    the recommendations; add suggests for osp, used in examples/Makefile
    for validation
  * README.Debian: some updates and expansions
  * XHTML 1.1:
    - fix a nasty bug in how xhtml-model.mod is referenced;
      reported upstream to W3C
    - NOTE: you cannot actually use XHTML 1.1 materials at this time,
      since there are missing components (xhtml-modularization and ruby);
      at this time, simply including those components won't actually work
      since the FPIs and file name provided by at least the latest
      xhtml-modularization does not match what is expected by XHTML 1.1.
      This also has been reported to the W3C; I am awaiting feedback from
      them on how to proceed -- copyright restrictions prevent me from
      wholesale modifiction to fix matters.

    entities or even both SDATA and CDATA entities.  Such sets are
    generally identified by their FPI ending in '//HTML'.  A possible

  	html-970421.decl	html 3.2 plus style
  	html-4.decl		html 4
  	html.decl		now the default, link to html-4.decl
  * added compatability links to declartions into /usr/lib/sgml/sgml
  * converted sgml_layout file to debiandoc SGML, now installed (still
    temporary) in /usr/doc/sgml-data/sgml_layout.html

sgml-data (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * added sgml-catalog-check.pl to manage links under /usr/lib/sgml, use
    this from debian/rules as part of build; script installed in
    /usr/lib/sgml-data
  * reinstanced links using this script, which made a lot of little changes
  * debian/makelinks, debian/dirs: removed, now irrelevant; now, when you
    add DTDs, you don't need to hack the rules at all
  * changed ncc-s.dtd public declaration: vendor is "Netscape Comm. Corp.",
    not "Netscape Comm. Corp. Strict".  This is in counter-distinction to
    the incorrect comment in the DTD itself.
  * SGML_layout: added section on issues to be resolved, clarify that the
    language specifier in the PUBLIC identifier should be stripped when
    making links
  * added entities:
  	HTML 2.1: html-2.1e.dtd
  	HTML 3.2+style: html-970421.dtd
  	HTML 4.0: html-4.0s.dtd, html-4.0-loose.dtd, html-4.0-frameset.dtd
  	HTML 4.0 entities: HTMLlat1, HTMLspecial, HTMLsymbol
  	  (closes Bug#18849)
  	HotJava: html-hj.dtd, html-hjs.dtd
  * renamed ncc-s.dtd to html-mcoms.dtd, renamed moz.dtd to html-mcom.dtd,
    added more public IDs for them
  * refresh from W3O: html-0.dtd, html-0s.dtd
  * aesthetic fixes to sgml.catalog
  * debian/rules: added -isp to dpkg-gencontrol, r-w on control

sgml-data (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer
  * debian/rules: clean up and abstraction like I like it
  * debian/rules: removed debstd and do it by hand (closes Bug#15404)
  * maintainer scripts improved to deal with arguments
  * postinst made into a perl scripts; strip out old version of sgml-data
    residuals from /etc/sgml.catalog; I have no clue why it would be in
    there.  I know this is against policy but this package put the bad
    data there in the first place.
  * removed unnecessary, non-std, leading zero from version
  * update to standards 2.4.0.0
  * updated entities and DTDs
  	ISOlat1 updated (closes Bug#10578)
  	ISOlat1.sgml removed (doesn't seem to be needed)
  	ISOlat2 updated
  	ISOpub updated
    	ISOnum updated
      	ISOtech updated
  	html-1s.dtd updated
  	html-3.2.dtd updated to Jan 7 1997 (final)
  	html-3s.dtd updated
  	ie-2.0.dtd updated (no actual changes, spaces only!)
  	ie-2.0s.dtd added
  	ie-2.0-tables.dtd added (unreported bug that it was missing)
  	ie-3.0 updated
  	ie-3.0s added
  	ie-3.0-tables.dtd added (unreported bug that it was missing)
  * added discussion on naming conventions in /usr/doc/sgml-data/SGML_layout
  * added MSIE DTDs to catalog file (closes Bug#12077)
  * ISO_8879:1986 is now ISO_8879-1986, which is what the W30 is pushing;
    sorry if it breaks anything --- if it imposes hardship, let me know
    and I can put in compatibility entities
  * removed DOCTYPE LINUXDOC because we aren't responsible for
    linuxdoc.dtd
  * removed SGMLDECL sgml/html.decl, because that's just obnoxious and
    outside of the scope of this package (closes Bug#10956)
