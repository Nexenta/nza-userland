 also includes standard character entity definitions which describe
 spacial characters or international characters, as well as other
 standard miscellany used by other SGML and XML packages.

 placement and registration.  This benefits the user by making the
 included materials instantly available to people writing, editing or
 building documentation without any further effort.  See
