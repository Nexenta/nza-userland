sudo (1.7.4p4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The HOME and MAIL environment variables are now reset based on the
  target user's password database entry when the env_reset sudoers option
  is enabled (which is the case in the default configuration).  Users
  wishing to preserve the original values should use a sudoers entry like:
     Defaults env_keep += HOME
  to preserve the old value of HOME and
     Defaults env_keep += MAIL
  to preserve the old value of MAIL.

  The change in handling of HOME is known to affect programs like pbuilder.

sudo (1.6.8p12-5) unstable; urgency=low

  The sudo package is no longer configured --with-exempt=sudo.  If you 
  depend on members of group sudo being able to run sudo without needing
  a password, you will need to put "%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL" in 
  /etc/sudoers to preserve equivalent functionality.
