python-cherrypy (2.2.1-3.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload by security team.
  * This update addresses the following security issue:
    - Directory traversal vulnerability in the _get_file_path function
      in filter/sessionfilter.py allows remote attackers to create or
      delete arbitrary files, and possibly read and write portions of
      arbitrary files, via a crafted session id in a cookie
      (CVE-2008-0252; Closes: #461069).

python-cherrypy (2.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    in the main python distribution; that is documented in
    README.Debian

python-cherrypy (2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    in a non-free package problem
  * debian/rules, debian/python-cherrypy.{postinst,prerm}:

    for python-support; using the package name is the correct,
    documented way of doing it.
  * debian/patches/01_auto-reload-with-python-support.diff:
  - removed because python-support >= 0.2, which I depend upon
    provides symlinks for the .py files;
  * debian/control:

python-cherrypy (2.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian revision with source package name change
  * changed source package name back to something more generic, since
    it seems like there won't be compatibility breakage again anytime
    soon
  * use python-support
  * debian/patches/eggify.diff:
  - add patch to provide EGG-INFO stuff, so that packages that depend
    on that information, such as TurboGears, will be able to use
    CherryPy
  * debian/patches/auto-reload-with-python-support.diff:
  - auto-reload doesn't like the .py files to be in a different path as the
    pyc files; I need a better solution for this, but for now the auto-reloader
    simply ignores the files in the cherrypy distribution (which is OK, since they
    are not supposed to be modified after the package is installed).
  * debian/control:
  - build-depends on python-setup-tools >= 0.6a9-1, needed to provide the
    EGG-INFO stuff
  * debian/copyright:
  - de-wikify the authors names
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
  - add dummy transition packages for python-cherrypy2.1, and deal with what
    cdbs's python stuff likes to do when it sees lots of python${ver}-module
    packages on the control file =D
  * debian/NEWS.Debian:
  - document big changes, and that this version is incompatible with
    CherryPy 2.0

    and that it's part of the Turbo Gears framework
  - changed maintainer to myself
  * debian/copyright:
  - modified downloaded from location to mention cherrypy.org instead
    of the sourceforge page

    directory since there's no tutorial in there
