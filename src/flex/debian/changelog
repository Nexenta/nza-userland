  * [d32c587]: [debiandir]: Regenerate autoconf files during
    configuration Upstream has versions of autoconf files that are stuck
    at the time of release. As newer versions of autoconf come out, and
    these nerw versions support more architectures, porting to them
    becomes harder if the package uses the now obsolete versionsof the
    files. Flex packaging now begins to reate autoconf and automake as
    real toolchain components, and re-creates the autoconf files at
    build time, and removes them while cleaning up. This should help out

flex (2.5.35-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * [f6cc9ae] Narrow buffer size changes to just IA64
    Increasing the buffer size on other architectures cause problems in
    corner cases not caught by the test suite. So perhaps it is not better
    to increase the buffer size unilatereally for all architectures, but
    to just increase it for the architecture it is required on, namely,
    IA64, and leave it unchanged on other architectures. This solution
    should fix the new grave bugs, while not reopening the original but
    that cause this change to be done in the first place.

flex (2.5.35-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "debian dir contains *.so", thanks to Raphael Hertzog
    This is a simple rname of a file used purely in packaging, and has low
    risk, but would allow compiling the flex source package with squeeze's
    packaging tools.                                     (Closes: #485095).
  * [88bb2fc] Fix generation of broken output on ia64 when input is piped in

    On ia64, flex appears to generate a completely different (and broken)
    output depending on whether the input file is specified using shell
    redirection or via a pipe.

    This was traced back commit 3971e1a917548977cff71418a7c3575ffbc9571f,
    by Alex Nixon <alex.nixon@citrix.com>: VFS: increase pseudo-filesystem
    block size to PAGE_SIZE. PAGE_SIZE on ia64 kernels is larger than most
    architectures - 16K is what most distributions (including Debian)
    use. An effect of the above changeset, as verified by strace, is that
    the read() and write() system calls issued by flex on a pipe will use
    this bigger size. fread() appears to be properly hiding the actual
    read size and is returning 8192 byte buffers to flex upon request. I
    verified by this by instrumenting YY_INPUT to compare the fread data
    with the original input file.

    Its probably useful to note that the corruption happening here is that
    the last 382 lines of the input file is being prefixed to the output
    file. The only differences in the remainder of the file are the #line
    numbers. I've also found that bumping YY_READ_BUF_SIZE up to 16384
    seems to workaround the problem - but that may just be putting it back
    into hiding.

    The tradeoff here is between correct operation, by making flex's
    buffer at least as big as the system buffer -- and not bigger, so that
    we do not waste memory. At this point, fixing the isue seems more
    important than worrying that flex consumes and additional 8KB of
    memory.

   This fix unblocks RC bugs on other packages.

  * Flex set yy_size_t to unsigned int; and used it where size_t was

    has declared size_t to be available in standard  C headers since 1989,
    which is 19 _years_ ago, I suspect we can start depending on size_t to
    be around and set correctly -- especially on Debian.

flex (2.5.33-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Starting with version 2.5.33-6 of flex we have started providing
    a static library compiled with position independent code, namely,
    libfl_pic.a.  The problem is with packages that contain share
    libraries with a flex scanner compiled in. Since flex generates code
    that is not self contained, and the missing symbols live in
    libfl.a. However, since linking a shared library with a object
    containing non position independent code stopped working with gcc 4.1
    (apparently, it was sheer luck that it worked at all). So now we also
    provide libfl_pic.a for shared library packages to link with.

    An alternative would have been to provide a full fledged
    shared library, but that would have been a major break with upstream
    and other distributions that also have flex, and would entail
    creating new library and devel packages for flex, which is more work
    that seems justified (considering that we would have to maintain the
    fork, and keep track of any ABI changes, and all that).

flex (2.5.4a-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * For machines that do not use the GNU libc (and thus, does not have
    gettext as part of the libc), flex failed to compile. The grep package
    has a macro to handle exactly this situation, elegantly,  which is
    labelled as available for public use, in it's aclocal.m4 file. This
    version of flex uses that. Many thanks to Joel Baker
    <lucifer@lightbearer.com> for discovering and testing this fix. 
                                                             closes: Bug#130220

flex (2.5.4a-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure that unistd.h is actually included, since we no longer
    provide a prototype for isatty.                           closes: Bug#97131

    thanks to Bruce Stephens for catching these quickly.

  * Fix a missing \ in the generated YY_INPUT macro.         closes: Bug#128412

flex (2.5.4a-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * if a signal is delivered while the parser is in the read routine
    (coded by flex), the result is flex reports and YY_FATAL_ERROR causing
    plan to exit.  The race condition appears much more frequently than
    one might expect because plan spends a good deal of time in read
    routine while gcc is preparing the input. I cleaned up another problem
    case beyond what is given in the patch.                  closes: Bug#125611
  * flex -o "ddd" doesn't write to the file "ddd", instead it tries to
    write to the file "" (yes, blank) and read from "ddd". I changed the
    main.c to use the next arg as the output file name if the next arg
    does not start with a -.                                 closes: Bug#122581

flex (2.5.4a-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * The flex-doc menu entry (/usr/lib/menu/flex-doc) contains some
    unquoted double quotes in its extended description, and these needed
    to be quoted so as not to confuse update menu. (why did it not
    generate an error?) closes: Bug#105272
  * The version 2.5.4a-12 was duplicated work with the previous maintainer
    (and I take the blame for the lack of communication). I have also
    managed to mosplace the changelog entry ;-(

flex (2.5.4a-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * I took over flex, and have brought the rules and pre/post inst files
    into line with my conventions.
  * flex generates c++ that does not use istream and ostream from the
    "std" namespace, so compilation of generated code fails. closes: Bug#104067
    Please note that this duplicates and replaces the work done in 2.5.4a-12
