This package was debianized by Ernesto Hernández-Novich (USB) <emhn@usb.ve>
using dh-make-perl on Fri, 30 May 2008 11:12:45 -0430.

There was no explicit copyright notice neither in the webpage nor in
the module distribution. I contacted the upstream author asking for
clarification and also opened up a bug in CPAN's RT; the author
replied via private e-mail with the following clarification.

In the interest of time:

Archive::Any is Copyright Clint Moore <cmoore@cpan.org>
