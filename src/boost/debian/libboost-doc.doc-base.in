Title: Boost C++ Libraries
Author: The Boost.org collaboration
Abstract: The Boost web site provides free peer-reviewed portable
 C++ source libraries.  The emphasis is on libraries which work
 well with the C++ Standard Library.  One goal is to establish
 "existing practice" and provide reference implementations so that
 the Boost libraries are suitable for eventual
 standardization. Some of the libraries have already been proposed
 for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's upcoming C++
 Standard Library Technical Report.
