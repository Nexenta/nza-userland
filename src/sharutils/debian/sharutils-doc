Title: GNU sharutils manual
Author: Jan Djarv and Fran√ßois Pinard
Abstract: This manual documents GNU sharutils.
 `shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
 them for transmission by electronic mail services.
 `unshar' helps unpacking shell archives after reception.  Other
 related utility programs help with other tasks.
 `uuencode' prepares a file for transmission over an electronic
 channel which ignores or otherwise mangles the eight bit (high
 order bit) of bytes.  `uudecode' does the converse transformation.
