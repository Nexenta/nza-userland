      This aligns with the glibc russian definition of ru_RU.KOI8-R in

  * Remove libx11-dev's dependencies on libxi-dev and libxkbfile-dev. Add a
    dependency on x11proto-input-dev instead. This should break some circular
    dependencies. Thanks go yet again to Kurt Roeckx.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Remove libx11-dev versioned dependency on libxext-dev. This was preventing
    bootstrapping of libxext. Thanks Eugene Konev.

  [ Denis Barbier ]
  * Add Build-Depends: x11proto-input-dev, quilt.  Thanks Kurt Roeckx.
    (Closes: #356918).

libx11 (2:1.0.0-3) experimental; urgency=low

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Stop using the xsfbs autoreconf script. The main beneft of using quilt in
    keeping the patches separate is for submitting things upstream and porting
    our changes between upstream releases. Keeping the automatically generated
    build system stuff in patches also doesn't fall under this use category.
  * Make libx11-6 conflict with xlibs-data. Thanks Kurt Roeckx.
    (closes: #356415)

  * Provide versioned build-depends on the X libs. Thanks Kurt Roeckx.
    (closes: #354161)
  * Provide libx11-dev dependencies on libxdmcp-dev.
    Thanks Kurt Roeckx. (closes: #354167)
  * Add a bunch of depends to libx11-dev from the monolith. Thanks Eugene
    Konev for the pointer.
  * Add 001_no_xkb_in_pc_file.diff because we don't need x11proto-input-dev.
    Thanks Eugene Konev.

  [ Eugene Konev ]
  * Move locale data in separate libx11-data package. Make libx11-6 depend
    on it.
  * libx11-6.install.in? Huh? Replaced with libx11-6.install
  * Add real binary-indep.
  * Add patches from 6.9:
    - 002_arm_abi_brain_damage.diff

    - 009_iso8859-15_Compose_Eurosign.diff
    - 012_ru_RU_UTF-8_XLC_LOCALE.diff
  * Adjust Pre-depends for libx11-6. Remove depends on x11-common from
    libx11-dbg and libx11-dev as they depend on libx11-6 anyway.
  * Run dh_install with --fail-missing if there is checkinstall in
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
  * Resurrect libx11-6.post{inst,rm}.in. Add genscripts to build target's
    dependencies.
  * Fix libx11-6.preinst.in to include shelllib and define appropriate vars.
  * Grab fixes for manpages section from Xorg CVS
    - 010_manpages_fix.diff
  * Grab ubuntu patch to support XLOCALELIBDIR separate from XLOCALEDIR
    - 011_stolen_from_ubuntu_xlocalelibdir.diff
  * Add --enable-loadable-i18n to confflags.

  * Add libx11-dev Build-Depends on x11proto-kb-dev, so we get XKBstr.h, which
    makes XKBlib.h usable.
  * Add foo_t and TRANS_CLIENT defines to Xtrans users; thanks Isaac Richards

libx11 (1:6.2.1+cvs.20050722-3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Make ErrDes.c and StrKeysym.c look for XKEYSYMDB and XERRORDB, not
    KEYSYMDB and ERRORDB, with the pleasant side-effect that they look
    directly in /usr/share/X11, not /usr/lib/X11, so we can throw the cheesy
    symlinks away.  This fixes some corner cases in hoary upgrades.

    /usr/lib/X11/locale because of limitations in the path-parsing code.
    Argh!
