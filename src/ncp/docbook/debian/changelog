  * New upstream release DocBook SGML 4.5 added (closes: #413166).

  [ Daniel Leidert ]
  * catalog: Made latest DocBook SGML 4.5 the default (closes: #413304).
  * debian/control: Added XS-Vcs-Browser and XS-Vcs-Svn fields.
    (Build-Depends-Indep): Fixed debhelper build dependency to be listed in
    Build-Depends.
    (Build-Depends): Added dpatch.
    (Uploaders): Added the Debian XML/SGML group and myself (closes: #358522).

    don't remove them in the clean target).

    README.docbook.dcl, that was not included in the package.
    (debian/docbook.install, debian/docbook.links): Made the dbgenent.mod
    files config-files.

    ArticleInfo; closes: #101779

    bother scrubbing legacy junk in prerm, since postinst configure
    already ran, what's the point?
  * provide new catalog entries for just referring to DocBook, generalized
    to mean the last recommended DocBook, or the latest DocBook v4, or the
    latest DocBook v3.

  * non-maintainer release, blessed by Mark Eichin
  * at the suggestion of Norm Walsh, retain DTD and entity file name

    others to file a bug if they agree with Norm.

    what it is in the archive, update description
