  * doc/gawk.info, doc/gawk.texi, doc/gawkinet.info, doc/gawkinet.texi:
    GFDL with invariant sections - removed and repackaged as 'gawk-doc'
    for non-free.  Closes: #357257
   * debian/rules (build): touch removed .info and .texi files in doc/ as a
     minimally intrusive (if nasty) way of pulling a fast one on the build
     system.
   * debian/rules (binary-arch): don't compress info files, instead remove
     the empty ones that now get installed.
   * debian/postinst: don't invoke install-info.
   * debian/prerm: likewise.

  * 20_eval.c-utf-8-strcat.dpatch: updated based on discussion with
    upstream to only manipulate 'l' not 'r'.

  * debian/postrm: remove pointless trailing 'exit 0'.
  * debian/prerm: #! as sh -e, rather than set-ing -e to be consistent
    with other maintainer scripts.

  * debian/rules (binary-arch): remove 2nd redundant chown to root.root of
    debian/tmp.  Move -maxdepth argument to find before -type to shut
    recent versions of find up.  Drop use of $(PWD) since it's unnecessary
    and we weren't using it consistently anyway.

    wide-char to{lower,upper}() handling.
  
  * 16_awkgram.y-stop-at-eof.dpatch: new patch by Andreas Schwab to stop
    gawk reading past the end of the file for an awk script that is big

    newline.

  * 17_fix-non-numeric-constants.dpatch: new patch by Aharon Robbins to
    improve handling of non-numeric constants so that numbers like 00.34
    don't get confused as being octal.
