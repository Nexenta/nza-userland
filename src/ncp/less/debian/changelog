    - Fix highlight bug when underlined/overstruck text matches at
      end of line.

  * Closes: Bug#79494: Lesspipe mishandles files with spaces, etc.
    I removed the single quotes around %s in the LESSOPEN and LESSCLOSE
    environment variables, although is re-actives an old bug (#25706). I still
    thinks it's sensible, because with the quotes in place, you cannot view
    any files with need-to-escape characters in their names, now you cannot
    view only files with '#' as the first character, i.e. you can view them
    when you write the path ahead (e.g. 'less ./#file').
    Plus, I added a note to lesspipe that should lead people who fell into this
    trap door to the right direction.

  * Actually fix arj entry.  I'm not sure how the fix got reverted to the
    old entry.
  * Put '' around [:upper:] and [:lower:] in tr call to protect them from
    the shell.  Thanks to Alexey Marinichev <lyosha@math.uu.se>.  (Fixes
    Bug #22311)
  * I wasn't paying attention and thought that tempfile just gave me a
    filename rather than creating a file.  This of course doesn't work.
    Now we only create the file when we need to.  Thanks to Roberto
    Lumbreras <rover@lander.es> for pointing this out.  (Fixes Bug #22320)
  * Updated standards version to 2.4.1.0.  Our one non-compliance was
    insecure tempfiles.

  * Modified rules so that you no longer have to be root to build the
    package.  (Fixes Bug #15454)
  * Made lessopen tmp-secure (depend on debianutils >= 1.8 for tempfile).
    (Fixes Bugs #19796, #15463)
  * Made the filename canonically lowercase for matching in lessopen.
  * Added directories, .bz, .bz2, .rpm entries to lessopen.  (Fixes Bugs
    $14200, #17486)
  * Fixed arj entry to use the correct options.  (I didn't have any .arj
    handy.)  (Fixes Bugs #17114, #17520)
  * Linked lesspipe.1.gz/lessfile.1.gz to undocumented.7.gz until I have
    time to write a real manpage.  (Works on Bug #15961)

  * Quote the arguments to lesspipe so that it can handle filenames with
    special characters such as '#'.  Suggestion from Richard Braakman.
    Thanks, Richard!  (Bug #11859)
  * Recompile with libc6.  (Bug #11695)
  * Use update-alternatives to register less(1) as /usr/bin/pager at level
    77.  (Bug #12474)
  * Told less(1) to use /usr/bin/editor if the envar EDITOR isn't set.
    Changed defines.h.in to not redefine EDIT_PGM and removed checking the
    VISUAL envar for the program to use.
  * Register bug on less since it should depend on -something- installing
    /usr/bin/editor but nothing I've seen does yet.

  * Upstream upgrade.  This fixes bug #5483, #6492, and #9408.
  * Removed changing the editor to ae.  This closes bug #8036 and makes me
    quite happy.
  * Changed rules file to only ask for a password during clean if it needs
    it.
  * Included a LESSOPEN script.  See /usr/doc/less/LESSOPEN for details.
    This closes #3952 and #8111.
  * Applied patch to screen.c from Herbert Thielen so that less properly
    sets raw mode if stderr is redirected to /dev/null.  This closes
    #5512.
  * NEWS is now installed as /usr/doc/less/changelog, mode 0644.  This
    closes #7835 and 7837.
  * README is no longer included in the binary package since it's just
    directions on how to install less.  This closes #7836.

less (321-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to dpkg standards version 2.1.1.2, changed the rules file to
    the format that I'm used to.  This fixes #3336.
  * Convinced less to use ae as the default editor.  I can't stand it but
    it's guaranteed to be on every debian system.  Changed defines.h.in so
    that I don't get lots of redefine errors.
  * Reformatted the Description in the control file to clear #3616
  * It seems that the upstream release fixed the annoying 0 length bug.
    This closes #4178, #4586, #4762, #6214, #6612

Tue Jul 23 13:52:10 1996  Erick Branderhorst  <branderh@debian.org>

	* mainstream update less 321.
	* modified debian.control & debian.rules for version, architecture
	* make install prefix instead of debian.rules specific install

1.  Added debian.* files

The following changes are from Bill Mitchell:
Changes for less-290-8
	elf package
	* rebuilt using ncurses shared lib
	* changed ncurses-runtime dependency to ncurses3.0

Changes for less-290-7
	elf package
	* added bugfix in #ifdef LINUX code in ch.c

Changes for less-290-6
	elf package
	* rebuilt for elf

Changes for less-290-5
	aout package
	* use alternative patch from Raul Miller to handle /proc files

Changes for less-290-4
	aout package
	* hacked filename.c with a workaround for a kernel bug
	  for files in /proc,
	      stat(filename) returns st_size set to 0
	      lseek(fd, (off_t) 0, 2) returns 0
	  this hack determines filesize by reading thru the file byte by byte
	  this doesn't address lseeek() being broken, and less(1) will
	  probably still misbehave if any /proc files are big enough
	  to make it want to use lseek()

Changes for less-290-3

1.  Added #ifdef DEBIAN block in screen.c to abort on unknown
    terminal types instead of attempting to continue (due to
    an apparent libtermcap.a bug which segfaults on tgetflag("hc")
    for unknown terminal types).

2.  Added -DDEBAIN to cflags in debian.rules.

3.  Added build as a dependency to binary: target in debian.rules.

4.  Modified ./configure invocation handling in debian.rules.

Changes for less-290-2

1.  Cleaned up description and extended description on debian.control.
