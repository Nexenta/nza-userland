gdbm (1.8.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sylvain Beucler <beuc@beuc.net> ]

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Replace obsoleted automake1.4 with automake; gdbm does not use
    'automake' itself but uses 'aclocal' which is provided by that package
    Closes: 549099 
  * Fix patch-system-but-no-source-readme: add README.source refering to
    /usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz
  * Fix debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error: test for Makefile presence
  * Fix package-contains-empty-directory: drop empty usr/share/info/ from
    libgdbm-dev
  * Fix no-md5sums-control-file: manually generate md5sums control file
    using code from dh_md5sums
  * Fix install-info-used-in-maintainer-script: remove postinst.dev and
    prerm.dev, and depends on 'dpkg (>= 1.15.4) | install-info'
  * Fix no-symbols-control-file: import base symbols file from
    http://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/mole/seedsymbols/?pkgname=libgdbm3 to
    'debian/symbols' and drop Debian version number. Keep private _gdbm
    symbols pending discussion with upstream about declaring them
    'static', but tag them 'optional'.

gdbm (1.8.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/postinst, debian/postrm: invoke ldconfig for configure and
    remove respectively.  Closes: #364502
  * debian/rules (binary-libgdbm): install them.

  * 05_handle-short-read.dpatch: new patch for Steve Langasek to make gdbm
    handle read(2) returning less data than we asked for.  Closes: #274417

  * Rebuild with modern glibc.  Closes: #321723

  * Following is based on a patch from NIIBE Yutaka <gniibe@fsij.org> to
    support cross building. Closes: #283065
   * debian/rules (build): pass --host to configure if cross compiling.
   * debian/rules (binary-libgdbm): invoke 'make install' with a correct
     INSTALL_ROOT instead of installing the shared libraries byhand.  We
     have to clean up afterwards (i.e. remove stuff that should be in
     libgdbm-dev, fix the permissions and strip the libraries), but doing
     so allows us to...
   * debian/control (Build-Depends): drop chrpath.

  * debian/control (Standards-Version): update to 3.6.2.2.
  * debian/copyright: update FSF address and copyright years.
  * debian/rules: likewise.

    ``, don't use - prefix with rm -f, split long lines, etc.

  * 06_manpage-cleanup: new patch.  Fixes section in TH and
    hyphen-used-as-minus warnings as noticed by lintian.

  * debian/rules: include /usr/share/dpatch/dpatch.make.
  * debian/rules (build): depend on patch-stamp.

gdbm (1.7.3-27) unstable; urgency=low

  * No 1.8 yet because a) the soname has changed, making packaging it less
    trivial, b) the upstream changes are not hugely important and c) 1.8
    appears after 5 years of upstream inactivity and has since been
    followed by another 18 months of upstream inactivity despite some
    trivial and annoying build bugs in 1.8 which must hit almost everyone
    who tries to build it from source.

  * Migration warnings are left unchanged as a result of (c) above.

  * Drop support for libc5.  rules and control files updated and
    libc[56]-? suffix removed from maintainer script names. Closes:
    bug#54401.

    (2/2)]
  * debian/rules: conditional on a glibc2.1-based architecture, install
    ndbm.h as ndbm.h rather than gdbm-ndbm.h as it's installed as on

Old Changelog:
TODO
* Currently:
  'Conflicts: libgdbm, perl5 (<=5.002-2), man (<=2.3.10-5)'
  The actual problem versions of perl5 and man (which were linked against
  the wrong .so version are from December 1995, and were unstable tree;
  I suspect that nobody is using them anymore. Should I remove them?
* Uses '<=' and '>=' in control files. Is this really a problem?


libgdbm1-1.7.3-11 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Fix to the upgrading scheme, as per Ian Jackson's message:
  * Include .so.major -> .so.version link after .so.version itself in .deb
    file

libgdbm1-1.7.3-10 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Changes to the upgrading scheme, as described by David Engel <david@ods.com>:
  * No more .dist install, mv-ing etc.
  * Include .so.major -> .so.version link before .so.version itself in .deb
    file

libgdbm1-1.7.3-9 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Added 'Section: base' to runtime control file, since perl uses libgdbm.
* Use fcntl locking (POSIX) instead of lockf (BSD). Noted by Neal Becker
  <neal@ctd.comsat.com>. This is just to be on the safe side. I don't
  think it makes any difference - flock(2) states "Under Linux, flock is
  implemented as a call to fcntl".
* Include extended descriptions in announcements.
* Fixed depends line in control file.
* Package revision wrapped into version field.
* Hello-style diffs.

libgdbm1-1.7.3-8 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Produce correct diffs. Noted by Rolf Russius <rossius@hrz.tu-chemnitz.de>.

libgdbm1-1.7.3-7 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Fixed serious problem with upgrades. Noted by David Engel <david@ods.com>.
* Added Section: field to devel control file.
* Added orig target to debian.rules and modified diff target.
* Fixed dependency.
* Added conflicts for perl and man version that were linked with the wrong
  .so version.

libgdbm1-1.7.3-6 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Several small fixes: dependencies, ldconfig, libgdbm.so link.
  Install info documentation via install-info.
  Removed backward compatibility link. Requires perl and man to be
  recompiled.
  Suggested by David Engel <david@ods.com>.

libgdbm1-1.7.3-5 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* ALPHA RELEASE. Do not install unless you know what you're doing
* Added extended description.
* Use -fomit-frame-pointer with -O2 -fPIC. The warning against
  buggy code generation seems to be outdated.
* Encode major library number in package name.
* Several upgrading/cleaning/administration issues, suggested by
  David Engel <david@ods.com>.

libgdbm-1.7.3-4 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* First version since renaming to be announced on debian-changes.
* Install dbm.h compatibility header, instead of symlinking;
  Install nbdm.h . Noted by David Engel.
* Provided symlinks to gdbm.3gdbm for the dbm and ndbm compatible symbols.
  Suggested by David Engel.
* Manpages now have a .3gdbm suffix.
* Use VPATH to build static and shared libraries in separate directories.

libgdbm-1.7.3-3 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Don't do -fomit-frame-pointer optimization with -O2 -fPIC, since
  this may generate buggy code w/ gcc 2.7.{0,1}.
* Changed gdbm.3 to gdbm.3gdbm; made symlinks for the various gdbm_
  symbols; made dbm.h symlink. Thanks to David Engel <david@ods.com>
  for his suggestions.

libgdbm-1.7.3-2 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Renamed to libgdbm. Added 'Provides: elf-libgdbm' to control file.
* Use /usr instead of /usr/i486-linuxelf; part of Debian's move to ELF.
* Added 'Depends: libc5'. This also fixes Bug#1761.
* Changed symlinks for shared libs.

elf-libgdbm 1.7.3-1 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Use install-info for gdbm.info .
* Added dbm to gdbm links.
* Make softlinks instead of hardlinks.
* Fixed typos in debian.rules which caused wrong links.

elf-libgdbm 1.7.3-0 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Initial release.
