OpenMPI for Debian - Developer Notes
------------------------------------

MPI Alternatives
----------------

The current OpenMPI version of Debian uses the Debian Alternatives system.
Although OpenMPI might replace most of the existing MPI implementations in the
future (see http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=general#why), we decided to
not affect any other MPI implementation already installed on your system.

You can setup OpenMPI as default MPI implementation by selecting openmpi as
the "mpi" alternative:

  update-alternatives --config mpi

Please note that there is a bug in update-alternatives (namely #388313) that
may cause trouble when you install several development packages of other
MPI implementations, i.e. LAM or MPICH.

If you would like to build Debian packages that link against multiple MPI 
implementations, we recommend to point your build system to the locations
under /usr/lib instead of relying on update-alternatives. This may also allow
parallel builds.
