This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of 4.4BSD make (pmake).

This package was put together by James Troup <james@nocrew.org>, from
sources obtained from:
 ftp.netbsd.org:/pub/NetBSD-current/src/usr.bin/make/
 ftp.openbsd.org:/pub/OpenBSD/src/usr.bin/mkdep/
 ftp.netbsd.org:/pub/NetBSD-current/src/share/mk/
This package was rebuilt by Sam Hocevar <sam@zoy.org> from the NetBSD
CVS tree available from:
 cvs://anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot (module /src/usr.bin/make/)

Changes:
 o added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files.
 o var.c: #include <stdio.h> because <regex.h> needs it.
 o util.c: don't try to redefine libc functions by #ifndefing a large
           chunk on (__linux__).
 o mk/bsd.doc.mk: don't give groff explicit macro paths; instead let it work
                  them out for itself.
 o mk/bsd.lib.mk: added a machine definition "debian" for Debian GNU/Linux.
 o mk/bsd.man.mk: correct CATDEPS, Herbet Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>.
 o mk/bsd.own.mk: change MANDIR and DOCDIR to reflect the FSSTND
                  orientated Debian GNU/Linux directory structure
                  (i.e. /usr/share/* -> /usr/*).
 o mk/bsd.own.mk: s/wheel/root/g.
 o mk/bsd.own.mk: define MANZ.
 o mk/bsd.own.mk: don't make files unwritable by owner.
 o mk/bsd.prog.mk: undefine LIBCRT0.
 o mk/sys.mk: MAKE should be pmake and not make on Debian GNU/Linux.
 o mk/sys.mk: tsort from bsdmainutils doesn't accept -q as an argument, 
              so don't try to pass it.
