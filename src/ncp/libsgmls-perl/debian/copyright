This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of David Megginson's
sgmlspm-1.03ii Perl modules for processing sgmls and nsgmls output.

This package was put together by me, Ian Jackson
<ijackson@gnu.ai.mit.edu>, from the sources on src.doc.ic.ac.uk in
/packages/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/SGMLS/SGMLSpm-1.03ii.tar.gz.
The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme, by adding various debian/* files.
