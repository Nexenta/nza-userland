    (Closes: #328200)
  * Update the copyright file, and add all missing copyright
    notices and licences to it.
  * Add Depends on lsb-base, since the init scripts makes use of it now
    and it's not essential.
  * Always stop call the init script to stop the daemon in the postinst
    on configure.  Older versions upto and including 1:4.2.0a+stable-8.2
    could remove ntp-simple | ntp-refclock before ntp-server, and when
    ntp-server then tries to stop the daemon it doesn't find the binary
    and the init script doesn't do anything.

  * Remove pre-sarge upgrade parts of the maintainer scripts.  The files
    now only have debhelper generated things in them, so they got deleted:
    ntpdate.preinst, ntpdate.prerm, ntp-doc.prerm, ntp-server.preinst
    and ntp.postinst.  This also really fixes #312331 be removing the code.

ntp (1:4.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * add debconf support, borrowing lightly from the Progeny implementation,
    and examples in other Debian packages.  The list of servers to be used by 
    ntpd and ntpdate are now shared.  A side effect of debconf support is use 
    of /etc/default/ntp-servers, which means /etc/init.d/ntpdate no longer 
    needs to be modified by hand.  The admin may optionally do it all manually.

    design for the package restructuring, closes: #109247
  * ntp-simple and ntp-refclock made self-sufficient with respect to config
    files, and suggest ntp.  this allows a very small filesystem footprint
    if all you really want is a daemon.  most users are expected to pick the
    ntp package, which depends on ntp-simple or ntp-refclock, with the

    ntp packages provided.  closes: #110583

    to deliver the actual daemon.  The simple version uses minimal memory, 
    the refclock version includes all the drivers for radio clocks.  
    closes: #52903, #98484, #56991
  * eliminate the xntp3 package, since it existed to smooth upgrades to 
    potato, and should no longer be needed when woody releases

    potential for remote root exploits.  patch will cause the daemon to log

    in the context of apt, and remove the conflicts that are keeping the
    meta package from being useful.  Target frozen since the meta package
    was added for potato, and is useless without this change given how apt
    treats suggestions.  Closes: #56822
  * include some information about hwclock in README.Debian, closes: #56755
  * pick up 4.0.99c upstream, since all the changes relevant to us appear to
    be documentation fixes, and they seem worth having.  Closes: #56598

  * new upstream source, ntpsweep now included upstream, closes: #53858, #54168
  * add xntp3 meta-package to facilitate slink->potato upgrades since package
    names changed, closes: #53532
  * the cron.weekly/ntp script deletes files in /var/log/ntpstats that are
    older than a week.  this means that at most 2 weeks of daily stats files
    have been present at any given time.  since deleting these old stats file
    does not require daemon cycling, I'm moving this to a cron.daily so only
    a week of files will be present.  Closes: #53598
  * while I'm messing with log rotation, modify cron.weekly to invert the
    nesting of the conditions.  This way, if there is no logfile definition
    in /etc/ntp.conf, and ntpd is therefore using syslog(), we won't kill and
    restart the daemon to rotate the non-existent log file.  
  * update configure-ntp to comment-out the logfile definition so that ntpd
    will use syslog, and not require cycling weekly for log file rotation.  
    This will cause ntpd logging to end up in daemon.log, since we do not have
    a LOG_NTP facility at this time, forcing ntpd to use LOG_DAEMON.  Wishlist
    bug filed against libc6-dev asking for a LOG_NTP.  Leave the cron.weekly
    alone, and don't do anything automatic to remove the logfile entry from
    /etc/ntp.conf... but add a note to README.Debian explaining the choices.
