ntp (1:4.2.4p0+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of ntp will periodically rescan the network interfaces to
  pick up new and deleted interfaces.  This should supplant most or all
  of the various workarounds in use such as restarting the daemon in
  /etc/network/if-up.d/ or /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/.

ntp (1:4.2.2+dfsg.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  ntpdate is no longer started from an init script but instead by ifup.
  The specifics can be configured in /etc/network/if-up.d/ntpdate.

  Installing ntp and ntpdate together is obsolete.  ntp is now configured
  by default in such a manner that it handles the initial clock adjustment
  by itself.

ntp (1:4.2.2+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The packages ntp, ntp-server, ntp-simple, and ntp-refclock have been
  merged into a single package ntp.

  Support for the following clocks have been removed because they didn't
  have a license on it: wharton and neoclock4x.

ntp (1:4.2.0a+stable-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  The NTP server now runs as the user "ntp". (Obviously it retains its
  ability to change your clock. ;-)

ntp (1:4.2.0a+bk20040620-3) unstable; urgency=low

  If your system changes ethernet addresses (e.g. a roving laptop),
  you need to restart ntpd. A small script to do that is in
  /etc/interfaces/if-up.d/ntp-server. To enable it, remove the "exit 0"
  line.

ntp (1:4.2.0a-6) unstable; urgency=low

  The "noserve" configuration option was buggy in versions before 1:4.2.
  It did not restrict everything it was documented to restrict.

  The impact on existing configuration files is that if you have "noserve" in
  your /etc/ntp.conf, and you can no longer sync to your peers, you might
  need to replace the "noserve" option with "noquery" or "nomodify".

ntp (1:4.2.0a-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  Downgrading the NTP package will not work automatically because the init
  scripts have changed significantly.

  The old init scripts and cron.daily/weekly files for ntp-simple and
  ntp-refclock have been saved+disabled by renaming them to
  "NAME.dpkg-old". If you have made any changes to them, you need to port
  these changes to the new /etc/{init.d,cron.daily,cron.weekly}/ntp-server
  scripts.

  Likewise, if you changed the startup script's run order by renaming
  the links in /etc/rc*.d, you need to re-do this change.

ntp (1:4.2.0a-0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  Upstream has implemented their own patch for chroot-jail and change-uid.
  Predictably, they use different flags (-i and -u, not -R and -U).

  The Debian patch introduced in version 1:4.2.0-0.4 is therefore removed;
  -R and -U are no longer recognized.

ntp (1:4.2.0-0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  The common parts of the "simple" and "refclock" NTP server packages have
  been split off into their own package "ntp-server".

  "ntp-server" now contains the code which needs to run on the same system
  as the NTP server (example: startup scripts).

  "ntp" consists of those programs which access an NTP server either locally
  or across the Internet.

ntp (1:4.2.0-0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  /etc/ntp.conf and /etc/default/ntp are no longer generated by the
  postinst scripts. Instead, they're now regular conffiles. You will
  therefore see a standard "Update?" message from dpkg.
  You should answer "Y" if you did not modify your NTP configuration
  manually.

  The default NTP time server is "pool.ntp.org", which resolves to a
  list of public stratum-1 and stratum-2 servers. One of them will be
  picked semi-randomly each time your NTP server starts.

  Note that the default configuration does NOT send broadcasts and does NOT
  allow any remote queries.

  "Remote" is defined as non-RFC1918 network addresses, i.e. anything
  not in 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16. The ntp server
  does not try to discover any interface addresses. This is a feature.
