lam for DEBIAN
----------------------

Man pages for the MPI function calls are currently included in the 
lam-mpidoc package.

In the Debian lam-runtime package, the 'wipe' program produced by the
upstream source has been renamed to 'lamwipe' in order to avoid a
conflict with a file removal utility of the same name which is
separately packaged and supplied by the distribution.
