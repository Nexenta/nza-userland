turbogears (1.0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  - includes fix for SA autocommit, which was not working because
    the call was being optimized out;
    See: http://trac.turbogears.org/changeset/2874
    (Closes: #408358)
  * debian/control:
  - changed python-markup to python-genshi on Suggests, following the
    upstream (and Debian package) rename (Closes: #419567)
  - Build-Depends on python-support >= 0.6.4, which automatically renames
    the egg-info directories to remove the python version number from their
    names
  - updated build-dependencies according to the python policy (python-support
    and cdbs affected)
  - updated dependencies according to the requirements expressed in setup.py
  * debian/watch:
  - added to watch for new versions
  * debian/patches/01_disable_requirements.diff:
  - updated according to the changes in upstream package
  * debian/patches/04_keep_using_pyprotocols.diff:
  - added; reverse change done upstream which makes TurboGears
    depend on PEAK's peak.util.decorators module, which is not yet
    packaged for Debian; since the change is minimal and doesn't seem
    to affect other modules in TG, I decided to reverse it
  * debian/rules:
  - fixed pyversions script usage to only get the current default python
    version, in order to rename the egg-info directory
  - removed hack to rename the egg-info directory, since python-support
    0.6.4 already does this

    detect the Python version with which it was built
  * debian/patches/02_fix_toolbox_configuration.diff:
  - added; bug fix grabbed from the 1.0 branch of the upstream SVN;
    avoids bug in the Identity framework code which would not allow
    Catwalk to add users, and maybe more problems;
  * debian/control:
  - build-depend on python-all, for we will sometimes need
    python2.4, instead of simply 'python'
