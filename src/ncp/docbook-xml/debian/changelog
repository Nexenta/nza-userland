  * new upstream version
  * add home page and author to package description
  * 4.2.cr2: correct some references to CR1; some references remain
  * 4.2.cr2: correct some invalid system references to the ISO entities;
    this was a flaw in the 4.1.cr1 Debian versions
  * postinst machinery to remove reference to 4.2.cr1 catalog which is gone
  * The question of XML catalog report requires system-wide coordination;
    it's up to users to set this up for themselves; I don't know what I,
    as a person who is shipping this DTD, can do to help.
  
    For now, it is only shipped in the dir with the DTDs as 'catalog.xml'.
    When there is a policy for me to follow to register it, I will gladly
    follow it.  If anyone has a suggestion about how I can better handle
    the situation in a way that will not cause user confusion or break
    backwards compatibility for folks using jade to process XML (like me),
    please do let me know.  Bug #134789 reassigned for sgml-base for
    planning; probably will result in a new xml-base package.
