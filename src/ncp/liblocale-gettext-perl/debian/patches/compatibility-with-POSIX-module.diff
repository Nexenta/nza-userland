Description: Re-export LC_* constants of the POSIX module
 Locale::Gettext exports by default the various LC_* constants as does the
 POSIX perl module. Up to perl-5.10, their definition was strictly the same
 and didn't cause any harm. Now the POSIX module evolved slightly and the
 symbol redefinition are conflictual and generate warnings.
 .
 Resolve this by making sure that Locale::Gettext reexports the constants
 coming from the POSIX module.
