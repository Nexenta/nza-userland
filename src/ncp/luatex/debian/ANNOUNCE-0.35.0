Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.35.0.

This is a beta in the process towards 0.40.0, the version that
will be included in texlive 2009. We have two big developments
underway right now:

* Hartmut is working on the DVI and PDF output, aiming for full
  support of all direction specifiers in both modes.
* Taco is working on extending the math engine, aiming for complete
  support of the OpenType and MathML concepts.

Both developments are well under way, but neither is perfect yet.
The main goal of this release is to give Hans' ConTeXt mkiv code
and its users a chance to catch up and test the progress so far.


What's new:

* The math handling portions of LuaTeX are converted to C code,
  and extended to support Unicode math. There are a great many
  related changes, see the new Math chapter in the manual for
  details.
* A nasty bug in the paragraph breaking routine was fixed.
  (All lines except the first one were believed to be wider then
  they really were. This affected which nodes were considered
  as active breakpoints)
* Various changes to the PDF backend to make it support non-latin
  directions.
* Fixed the behaviour of the page offsets. Placement of the output
  on the physical page should now work correctly in all directions,
  both in DVI and PDF.
  There now are \pageleftoffset and \pagetopoffset primitives.
* fontforge.apply_featurefile() was broken since 0.31.0
* The lua profiler library is added.
* The included lua filesystem library is now 1.4.1.
* Reading of pk files fixed.
* An optional space afer a <direction specifier> for \textdir c.s.
  is ignored from  now on.
* \bodydir and \pagedir can now be (re)set even after the first
  page has been output.
* The new callback mlist_to_hlist can be used to intercept the
  normal conversion of math lists to horizontal lists.
* The programs ttf2afm and pdftosrc are removed from the luatex
  distribution (these belong to pdftex).
* fontforge.open() now uses much less memory when opening large
  (CJK) fonts.
* The included libpng is now 1.2.35.
* Quite a lot of smaller bugfixes and cleanups (as usual).


The archives (just binaries at this time, hopefully there will be a
source package later) can be downloaded from supelec as usual:
