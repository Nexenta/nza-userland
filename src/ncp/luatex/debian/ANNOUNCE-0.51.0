Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.51.0.

New features:

* Various small manual improvements.
* The backend message "cannot open Type 1 font file for reading"
   now reports which Type1 font it was looking for.
* Fontforge clears some font names at loading time that will be
   refilled in at font generation time, but the fontloader should not
   do that. Patch from Khaled Hosny.
* New synctex code imported from TeXLive.
* luamd5/md5.h is renamed to luamd5/luamd5.h to avoid confusion.
* Embedded mplib is now 1.209.
* Some experimental tweaking of buildpage_filter, see the manual
   for details.
* Luatex now detects kfreebsd (from Alan Braslau)
* The new lua function tex.sp() converts a string to a number
   representing scaled points.
* There is now support for revision numbers in the banner and stats
   library again.
* The command line help and manual documentation page is extended.
* node.hpack() now also accepts "cal_expand_ratio" and "subst_ex_font"
   modifiers.
* node.hpack() and node.vpack() now give back the badness of the box
   as second return value.
* node.copy_list() now allows a second (stop) argument, this stopper
   is not copied.
* new lua functions in lfs: lfs.readlink() and lfs.shortname().
* new lua function tex.tprint() that can combine multiple catcode
   regime prints in one function call.
* new lua sub-table: tex.nest[] (read/write access to the semantic
   nest state).
* New lua functions in kpse: kpse.lookup() and kpse.version(). See
   the manual for more details.
* New lua function tex.shipout().

Bug fixes:

* There problems in the pdf output for Type3 (pk) fonts.
* Fix a bug that allowed bad commandline quoting.
* Fix a bug that sometimes caused crashes when \pdfprotrudechars.
* The build script now exports CONFIG_SHELL to avoid problems with
   /bin/dash.
* The was a bug in the generated /Image /ProcSet.
* status.font_bytes reported the wrong value.
* Lots of compiler warnings are removed (thanks Javier Mugica).
* Patch to fontloader.info() to accept filenames with embedded
   parentheses.
* Fix a \write error with docstrip package.
* Fixed a crash on AdobeMyungjoStd-Medium.otf.
* Fix coco stack overflows, needed for lpeg.
* \pdfcompresslevel wasn't initialized for early immediate objects.
* Fix for slanted fonts when HZ was on (slant angle was multiplied).
* When concatenating content streams, put a space between them.
* Allow pfb lines to end with \r as well as \n (for msam10.pfb).
* Fix the internal string->scaled point conversion in the lua
   interface.
* Memory leaks in the fontloader removed, thanks to patches from
   Elie Roux.
* Fix a crash caused by the combination of coroutines and font.each().

Removed features:

* Support for Type3 .pgc files (nobody used them).
