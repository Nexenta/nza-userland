Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.40.6 to the foundry server,
and have committed the source code to texlive.

What's new:

* Fix two string vs. toks bugs in the lua node interface:
  whatsit,annot and whatsit,startlink data assignments were
  made directly as strings instead of being converted to tokens.

* Sometimes pdf.print() could be used before the proper structures
  were initialized.

* There was a bug in the type codes for the lua package filter
  callback: wrong extra info was passed to lua for the alignment
  and vsplit cases.

* The math parameters \Umathlimitdownvgap, \Umathlimitdownbgap,
  and \Umathlimitdownkern have been renamed to \Umathlimitbelowbgap,
  \Umathlimitbelowvgap, and \Umathlimitbelowkern to be more
  consistent with the other parameter names.

* The embedded MPlib is now 1.204.

* Handling of UTF-8 hyphenation exceptions has been fixed.

* There were a number of typos in the manual.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:
