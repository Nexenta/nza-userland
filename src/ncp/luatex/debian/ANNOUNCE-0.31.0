Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.31.0.

This is just an intermediate release so that some testing can be
done on the updated fontforge embedding.

* There are new fields being generated by fontforge.to_table(),
  and one or two old ones have been removed. These fields are /
  will be documented in the manual, but very briefly:

  - MATH table and associated information are now exported
    (the main reason for the new fontforge code)
  - Baseline data is now exported
    (perhaps usable in lua code)
  - Multiple Master / Glyph variation data is now exported
    (but useless, for now)
  - Mac Feature (AAT) information is now exported
    (perhaps usable in lua code)
  - If (lookup) names were saved via the PfED table, these
    will the exported instead of the default, generated names.
    (as requested by Yannis)

* dfont is now treated as an archive format just like ttc
  when it comes to fontforge.info(). NOTE: that does not mean you
  can actually use them, because the  backend doesn't know
  yet how to embed dfont fonts in the PDF, that is on the
  TODO list for the next big beta (0.40.0).

* The executables are a lot larger than before. That is because
  much more of fontforge is included than before. Likely this
  will stay this way, because this makes upgrading the ff code
  much easier, and it means that luatex/FF potentially
  understands more font formats (after upgrading the backend,
  of course)

The archives (just binaries this time) can be downloaded from
supelec as usual:
