Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.40.3 to the foundry server,
and have committed the source code to texlive.

What's new:

* A set of portability fixes for the AIX compiler from Vladimir
  Volovich.

* A set of fixes to the synctex support.

* A patch to the build script to prevent installed X11 headers
  from being required.

* Some weave (web syntax) fixes from Manuel Pégourié-Gonnard.

* A simplification in luatex.ch (it is now less verbose
  about the web2c-specific extensions) from Karl Berry.

* A fix in the handling of UTF-8 (input) file names.

* Hyphenation exceptions were case sensitive in 0.40.2.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.40.3

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco
