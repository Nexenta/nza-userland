* Updated to MPlib 0.40
* Bugfixes and cleanup in the lua img table code
* Fix \pdflastximagepages bug from pdftex
* Fix for very large tex.print strings
* Update to Lpeg 0.8.1
* &D Bugfix for Type1 fonts when out-of-range characters
   are marked as 'used'

The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
as usual:
