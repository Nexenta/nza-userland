Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.22.0.
The amount of changes in this beta is not enormous, but there
is interesting new stuff (most of that by Hartmut), and it
fixes a couple of pretty severe bugs.

What's new:

* We now have an official bug tracker: http://tracker.luatex.org
* A new lua library (img) is added that allows a direct
   interface to the image handling of luatex. You can use this
   to include images from lua code instead of via the more
   traditional \pdfximage cs. See the manual.
* An optional equal sign after \{pre,post}hyphenchar is now
   allowed.
* os.exec() has been extended, and os.spawn() added. These
   functions have support for quoted strings, and they
   also accept a table with preseparated command arguments.
* New string constants os.type and os.name are provided.
* node.last_node() is added. This pops and returns the last
   node from luatex's 'current list'
* node.write() is added. This appends a node to the end of
   luatex's 'current list' (experimental).
* The strict check on unicode compliance in pattern files
   is dropped. Patterns files still have to be in proper UTF-8
   encoding, but the error for non-Unicode character values
   (like 0 - 31 and 127 - 159) is dropped.
* \pdfadjustinterwordglue, \prependkern, \appendkern
   and associated \XXXXcode arrays are gone.
* The rest of the pdftex font arrays are now merged into
   the new luatex font data structure. This means that you
   can now set up font expansion from lua code, and that a few
   font-related limits are gone.
* The 'top_skip' field in 'insert' nodes is renamed to 'spec',
   for improved consistency.
* kpse.show_path() added. This behaves just like
   $ kpsewhich --show-path
* The unicode.utf8 functions now also accept values in the range
   1.114.112 - 1.114.367 that is used by LUATEX for raw byte output.

What's been fixed:

* Better node memory (de)allocation error tracking and messages
* Compilation on MacOSX 10.5 was broken
* There was a bug in node.insert_after
* Use of \{pre,post}hyphenchar was broken
* lfs.permissions was leaking memory
* Some warning and error messages are improved a bit
* A set of bugs in character protrusion, this seems to be working
   ok now.
* Also, a set of bugs in font expansion. This now works in most
   cases but is not quite bugfree yet (problematic files for testing
   are welcomed).
* The functions in the kpse library would crash luatex if
   kpse.set_program_name() was not yet called. gives an error now.
* Alignments with spanned columns could cause crashes
* A patch is added for problems with filename parsing on the
   "first input line" (by Jonathan Kew)
* The hpack_filter and vpack_filter were only called for lists longer
   than one node.
* Luatex is now more forgiving about font subsets being smaller
   than their expected size (issues a warning instead of aborts now)
* A "double-free ignored" error for paragraphs with lines starting
   with discarded items was fixed.

The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
as usual:

Have fun,
