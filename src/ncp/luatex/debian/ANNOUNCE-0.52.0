Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.52.0.

New features:

* Various small manual improvements.

* A better version of getluatexsvnversion.sh, from Tomek.

* node.copy_list() now allows the second (optional) argument to
   be nil.

* An import of the current state of the texlive repository
   (kpathsea and build system).

Bug fixes:

* An attempt fix for bug #345 (math kerning is not perfect): when the
   current math font is a new math font, check against \catcode <cur_c>
   == 11 to suppress the italic correction, instead of looking at
   the value of space(<cur_f>).

* There is a new <tfmtable> key: 'units_per_em' (defaults to 0).
   This is part of a fix for bug #200 (Problem with CFF fonts having
   em-size other than 1000): there is a special correction to the
   embedded cff font itself and the font scale if the font to be output
   is opentype or type1 in unicode encoding and the 'units_per_em
   differs' from zero.
   <tfmtable>.units_per_em has to be passed back to luatex from
   the lua font loading code for this to work.

* A fix for bug #314 (problem with pk file).

* lua code can no longer change the internal preallocated glue_spec
   nodes (as that resulted in weird spacing bugs). For this, glue_specs
   now have a new field: 'writable'. If that field is false, a copy
   has to be made of the glue_spec instead of doing an assignment
   to it.

* Setting of \textdir inside the output routine could trash output
   on following pages due to a lingering internal variable.

* \pdfthread crashed because the arguments were handled in reverse
   order.

The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:
