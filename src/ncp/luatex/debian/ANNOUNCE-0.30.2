Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.30.2.
This release matches SVN revision #1568.

This release fixes a few (rather serious) bugs:

* The Lua coco change from 0.30.1 is reverted as it gave
   trouble on MacOSX. Lua coco on non-intel OpenBSD platforms
   is now explicitly turned off.

* The lua file reading speedup in 0.30.1 broke reading of
   files larger than 100MB.

* Reading of font-related files was broken when there was a find
   callback, but no read callback.

* The texmf.cnf array size setup values were ignored whenever
   --lua was given on the commandline (instead of only when
   texconfig.kpse_init is set to false).

* glyphs with negative widths resulted in incorrect horizontal
   placement (overlapping) of the string in the output PDF.

* Using \latelua could sometimes result in an invalid output PDF,
   and the argument token list was expanded too early

* There was a read buffer overrun in the mapfile parser

* There are two new variables in the status table:
   status.callbacks and status.indirect_callbacks (execution counts).

The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
as usual:

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

Have fun,
