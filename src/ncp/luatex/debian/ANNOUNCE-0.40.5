Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.40.5 to the foundry server,
and have committed the source code to texlive.

What's new:

* One of the internal print functions accidentally encoded its
  argument string to UTF-8 even though it was already UTF-8.

* Some of the log and terminal UTF-8 output was gibberish.

The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.40.5

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco
