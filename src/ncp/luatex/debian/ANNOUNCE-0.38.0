Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.38.0.

This is a beta in the process towards 0.40.0, the version that
will be included in texlive 2009. This beta will be shortlived,
the plan is to release the next (hopefully last) intermediate
beta within a week.

What's new:

* tex.enableprimitives() had a bug were previously defined (but
  currently undefined) control sequences prevented the creation
  of the new csname.

* The special calling format callback.register('name', false)
  not only disables the callback, but also the builtin code it
  is supposed to replace.

* Empty \localleftbox and \localrightbox -es are now suppressed.

* Support for <f>.MathConstants.SubscriptShiftDownWithSuperscript
  was added, to solve the lack of "sub2" in OpenType math.

* Luatex now supports horizontal super- and subscript placement
  corrections via the OpenType MATH mathkern table. See the
  manual for details.

* node.write() no longer copies its argument node list before
  appending it.

* There are six new primitives that are verbose forms
  of one and two byte special tokens:
  \Usuperscript \Usubscript
  \Ustartmath \Ustopmath
  \Ustartdisplaymath \Ustopdisplaymath

* The attribute node leaks in math mode and alignmetns have been
  fixed.

* The 11 simple math noads are now combined into a single "noad"
  node type.

* Static linking against libstdc++ is working once again.

* There is a small fix in the keyword scanner to solve the
  problem of 'Runaway ... while scanning ???' that could happen
  for some primitives.

* Lua now also has the "architecture independent bytecode"
  patch applied.

* Lua is updated to version 5.1.4 with coco patches 1.1.5, and
  lpeg is now 0.9.

* Some TRT/TLT backend bugs are fixed.

* Various manual updates.
