luatex (0.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Starting with this version the luatex packages ships texdoclua, written
    by Frank KÃ¼ster. This program is a replacement for texdoc which operates
    much faster. Please see the man page for details.

    Furthermore the package installs a diversion of texdoc, so that as soon
    as you install luatex you will profit from the new texdoclua as texdoc.
