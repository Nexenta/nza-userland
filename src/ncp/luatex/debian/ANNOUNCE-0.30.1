Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.30.1.
This release matches SVN revision #1552.

There are no new features, just bugfixes and speedups:

* Invalid return values from the linebreak_filter callback
   are now handled gracefully (was crashing)
* a preinstalled ctangle is no longer needed except when
   cross-compiling
* In 0.30.0, the .notdef fix was incorrectly applied to
   truetype / opentype fonts.
* A bunch of all memory leaks is fixed
* In lua, f:read('*a') now uses signicantly less memory
* The number of \catcodetables is now limited to 64KB
   (for speed reasons)
* Luatex could crash if there were PDF images with and
   without page /Group included on the same page
* Lua coco now always uses setjmp (for OpenBSD compatibility)
* The embedded mplib is updated to the latest svn version
* # marks (characters with catcode 6) are no longer doubled
   inside \directlua
* Handling the nul character (U+0000) with catcode 13
   (active) was broken
* Luatex could crash on win32 with an access violation
   because there was one predefined language too few
   (the one matching \language=-1)


The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
