Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.40.1 to the foundry server,
and have committed the source code to texlive.

What's new:

* Vertical placement of root radicals and degrees is fixed.

* The use of \pageleftoffset could deviate from \hoffset
  if \mag != 1000.

* LuaTeX now issues a warning if \pagedir != \bodydir during
  shipout.

* The previous crash in font.read_tfm() was still not quite
  correct.

* The Web2C version is now also printed in the --version
  and --credits output.


* There is a new MPlib 1.200 release candidate with a few minor
  fixes included.

* The xpdf library is updated to patch level 3.

* New imports to the build system, from texlive. In particular,
  there is now configure-level support for building with
  libpoppler and support for building under cygwin 1.7 is added.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

        http://foundry.supelec.fr/projects/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

  svn co svn://scm.foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.40.1

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org


Have fun,
Taco
