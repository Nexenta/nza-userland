Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.29.0, another
intermediate release leading up to TUG 2008. This release
matches SVN revision #1450.

(In case someone notices: yes, I forgot to update CHANGES)

New features:

* The embedded pdftex is now 1.40.9 (forthcoming) except for the
   following:
   - the png transparancy fix is skipped because it is in conflict
     with a macro-based solution offered by context mkiv.
   - LFS (PDF files > 2GiB) is not working yet.
   - Synctex is still missing

* libpng, xpdf, and zlib are updated to their pdftex 1.0.9 levels

* MPlib is updated to 1.090

* The syntax of buildpage_filter is changed to avoid confusion
   (and crashes). See the manual for the new calling convention.

Bugs fixed compared to 0.28.0:

* The previous bugfix for \languages skipping numbers was wrong.

* Various compile-time warnings are suppressed

* \pdfsetmatrix was broken

* \pdfsave and \pdfrestore were broken

* Valid user_defined whatsits nevertheless were generating errors.


The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
as usual:

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

      http://tracker.luatex.org

Have fun,
Taco
