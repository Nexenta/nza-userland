Hi all,

I have just uploaded the archives for luatex 0.30.3.
This release matches SVN revision #1587.

This release fixes a really big bug, a few smaller ones,
and has updates of png and mplib:

* All hyphenation patterns that were anchored at the start or
  end of a word were ignored in luatex versions 0.25.X and 0.30.X
  (and possibly even earlier).

* Repeated use of \language=-1 could result in "There is not room
  for another language".

* The lua true coroutines patch (Coco) is now disabled on OpenBSD
  running on non-intel platforms.

* The lua socket library is patched so that it will now compile on
  OpenSolaris.

* Luatex now has libpng 1.2.33 and mplib 1.100


The archives (source and binaries) can be downloaded from supelec,
as usual:

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

       http://tracker.luatex.org

Have fun,
Taco
