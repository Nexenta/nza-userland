Hi,

I have just uploaded luatex 0.31.3. This release has a bunch of
updates from the development trunk. It is intended as a bug
release for 0.31.2 only, there are no new features.

  * Closing of files opened by \externalocp.

  * Fix for a locale-related bug that make PDF generation fail
    with a "Parsing CFF Dict failed" message when including
    opentype fonts.

  * The included metapost is now version 1.102.

  * PDF rules in vertical modes in RL direction where output
    in the wrong direction

  * Fix for a crash on Apple fonts that contain a 'bsln' table.

  * The handling of the second argument to fontforge.open() was
    broken

  * The included libpng is now 1.2.34

  * Handling of ttc files on Windows was broken


The archives (just binaries this time, hopefully there will be a
source package later) can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

If you need the sources, please check out via anonymous svn:

  svn co svn://scm.foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.31.3
