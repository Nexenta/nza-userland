"The dialog frontend is a full-screen, character based interface, while the "
"readline frontend uses a more traditional plain text interface, and both the "
"gnome and kde frontends are modern X interfaces, fitting the respective "
"desktops (but may be used in any X environment). The editor frontend lets "
"you configure things using your favorite text editor. The noninteractive "
"frontend never asks you any questions."
