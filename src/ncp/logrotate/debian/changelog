logrotate (3.7.8-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * New patch:
    + security-388608.patch: A race condition in the creation of 
      compressed and copied log files makes it possible to overwrite 
      arbitrary files by generating a link or symlink during a window 
      of opportunity between logrotate renaming a log file and creating 
      the copy of the next. (Closes: #388608) Once again, many thanks to
      Florian Zumbiehl for forcing me to think.
  * Uploading to unstable.

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Aug 2009 23:22:04 +0100

logrotate (3.7.8-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * New patch:
    + nofollow.patch: If a logfile is a symlink, it may be read when
      being compressed, being copied (copy, copytruncate) or mailed.
      Secure data (eg. password files) may be exposed. Thanks to
      Florian Zumbiehl for getting me thinking about this one.

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Thu, 06 Aug 2009 16:35:41 +0100

      (Closes: 388608)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Tue, 04 Aug 2009 21:16:03 +0100

  * Upstream has also fixed createOutputFile to be more secure
    (Closes: #388608)
  * New Debian patch:
    + sharedscripts-519432.patch: Prerotate and postrotate scripts get the 
      list of rotated files passed to them as arguments. (Closes: #519432)
    + chown-484762.patch: If running as non-root, warn but don't abort if
      we can't chown the compressed log file. (Closes: #484762)

    + rh-curdir2.patch: logrotate would crash under SELinux.

      (Closes: #435086)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Dec 2008 13:12:27 +0000

logrotate (3.7.7-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (based on upstream 3.7.7-1)
    + The source code has been run through "indent" which makes looking 
      for differences "interesting".
    + Debian patches no longer required:
      - compress-499502.patch: upstream has fix.
      - globfix-277652: upstream has a fix. In addition, logrotate will
        attempt to continue rather than stopping dead if there are any 
        errors in its config files. (Closes: #285858)

    + Upstream fixes:
      - Manpage fixed for example using /var/log/news. (Closes: #339502)

  * dateext-504079.patch: If dateext is used with delaycompress and 
    mailfirst, the wrong filename (one that has compressext added) is 
    attempted to be mailed. (Closes: #504079,#433496)
  * dst.patch: Update to add the current "hour" to the struct tm, so 
    that DST changes don't cause the date to be off by one.
    (Closes: #416177)
  * Corrected upstream URL (Closes: #410420)
  * deb-taboos.patch: added .cfsaved to taboo list. (Closes: #463581)

    missingok can be taken into account. (Closes: #277652)
  * Urgency high for RC bug.

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Wed, 08 Oct 2008 16:33:20 +0100

    /var/log/btmp. (Closes: #370050)
  * compress-499502.patch: Don't clobber existing files if in debug mode 
    and compressing. (Closes: #499502)

logrotate (3.7.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch debian/control to fix FTBFS on kfreebsd-amd64. Perhaps we need
    a build-depends macro for !kfreebsd. (Closes: #361465)
  * Use and depend on debhelper version 5.
  * Switch from dpatch to quilt.
  * cpp-crossbuild.patch: change from using $(CPP) to $(CC) -E.
    Thanks to NIIBE Yutaka. (Closes: #284040)
  * dst.patch: fix mktime initialisation so that daylight savings is
    taken into account. Thanks to Holger Weiss. (Closes: #278591)
  * man-333996.patch: fix typos in logrotate.8 where "then" should be
    "than". Thanks to Adrian Knoth. (Closes: #333996)
  * manpage.patch: Apply missed fixes from #101272. Thanks to J S Bygott.
    (Closes: #335060)

  * README.Debian: Document how scripts are called. (Closes: #308920)
  * Update the copyright file.
  * debian/control: remove versioned dependency on cron. The version of
    cron forbidden pre-dates woody (currently "oldstable") by several
    years. This versioned dependency is preventing logrotate being
    installed with bcron. (Closes: #304038, #349150)
  * debian/rules: Fix backports, allowing them to use selinux.
    (Closes: #340363)
  * uncompressChild-warning.patch: Fix a "might be used uninitialised" 
    warning from gcc.

logrotate (3.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (based on upstream 3.7.1-11)

  * This upload enables selinux code. (Closes: #193601, #315514)

  * Updated dpatches:
    + 30-config-h: upstream has changed to using "/bin/mail" instead of
      "/bin/mail -s"
    + No need for 41-execlp-fix or 42-execlp-bin-sh.
    + Upstream fix obsoletes 60-compressowner.

  * Upstream uses a patch system, too. Patches from upstream:
    + 01-rh-dateext (logrotate-3.7.1-dateext.patch)
    + 01-rh-maxage (logrotate-3.7.1-maxage.patch)
      dateext and maxage (Closes: #178526, #188198, #226061, #257685,
      #306304)
    + 01-rh-noTMPDIR (logrotate-3.7.1-noTMPDIR.patch)
      This has the effect of never requiring a tempdir for scripts.
      There's the possibility of large scripts running into stack
      limits.
    + 01-rh-selinux (logrotate-3.7.1-selinux.patch)
      Updates to selinux code.
    + 52-man-rh-1 (based on logrotate-3-man.patch)
      Explains a bit more about postrotate scripts and updates the
      sharedscripts entry.

  * Update Standards-Version (no changes needed).
  * Update copyright file with current upstream location.

logrotate (3.7-5) unstable; urgency=high

  Brown paper bag upload.

  * 42-execlp-bin-sh: Fix major flaw in the last patch... it tries to 
    execute the logfile. Thanks very much for the quick report, Philipp.
    It was my fault, not yours. (Closes: #279965)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Wed, 25 May 2005 10:43:42 +0100

logrotate (3.7-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * 42-execlp-bin-sh: Call /bin/sh directly for scripts. Allows /tmp to 
    be mounted noexec. This is a simple fix for sarge -- a potentially
    better fix is available upstream. Thanks to Philipp Hartmann. 
    (Closes: #279965)

  * Documentation fixes:
    + 52-man-overriden: Fix spelling of "overridden" in manpage.
      (Closes: #310337)
    + 52-man-mailtypo: Fixes formatting of the -mail option in manpage.
      (Closes: #300644)

logrotate (3.7-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * 41-execlp-fix: "critical" bug with execlp() call on scripts. 
    This affects only those who use the undocumented feature of the 
    arguments of the script being the files that are being rotated. 
    Oh rats... I've just documented it! (Closes: #276172)
    Thanks to Lars for the quick NMU.

  The rest of the changes are minor and are mainly to documentation:

  * Depend on cron | anacron | fcron. (Closes: #308172)
  * 52-man-sizetypo.dpatch fixes "size=100k" typo in manpage. Thanks to
    Ged Haywood for spotting this. Also spotted by Kjetil Kjernsmo
    (Closes: #272716)
  * 52-man-lastaction.dpatch fixes mistake in the lastaction
    description. (Closes: #278172)

    update the location of the cvs repository.
  * 52-man-startcount.dpatch, fixes manpage for "start" description.
    (Closes: #290628)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Mon, 16 May 2005 23:01:32 +0100

logrotate (3.7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added commented out stuff in debian/rules to build a 
    logrotate-selinux package should Russell's move to get libselinux1 
    made "base" fail.
  * Patch: 21-taboo-to-debug, reduces the "Ignoring..." messages of

    logs. (Closes: #253837)

logrotate (3.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to using dpatch to keep track of changes.
  * New upstream release:
    + Includes some SELinux code, not compiled in by default as
      libselinux1 is not a base package. (Refer: #224880)
    + Always use compressext for the extension for compressed
      files; before compresscmd and compressext had to agree
    + Compression and scripts don't use system() anymore
    + compress and maillast didn't work together properly
    + delaycompress and mailfirst didn't work properly
      (Closes: #186818,#211687)
    + Don't use system() for mailing (or uncompressing) logs anymore
    + missingok works on directories, too (Closes: #246352,#248318)
  * Manpage fixes:

    + Fix description of "compressext". (Closes: #230519)
  * Patches applied:

  * Standards-Version: 3.6.1
    + New default compilation options (10.1).

logrotate (3.5.9-10) unstable; urgency=high

  * cron.daily was getting deleted by the debian/rules script. Mea
    maxima culpa. (Closes: #152966).

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Jul 2002 00:08:37 +0100

logrotate (3.5.9-9) unstable; urgency=high

  * Downgraded depends on mailx to a recommends.
    (Closes: #127239, #149535)
  * Really put check for existence of logrotate binary into the
    cron.daily script. It was getting overwritten by a copy from the
    examples directory. (Closes: #150727)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Jun 2002 23:48:27 +0100

logrotate (3.5.9-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added check to cron.daily (blatantly stolen from exim's) to only

  * Priority high to ensure this minimal bugfix (a violation of a 
    "should" policy directive) gets into woody.

    (Closes: #56044)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Feb 2002 20:08:36 +0000

logrotate (3.5.9-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Further development on bug #118466. Use stat() rather than
    fgetc/ungetc. Thanks to Ian Wienand <ianw@ieee.org> for being
    unsatisfied with my previous attempts, which contained many
    logic errors. Mea culpa.
    (Closes: #119176)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Nov 2001 11:59:08 +0000

logrotate (3.5.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the logic error in the last two uploads. Use fgetc/ungetc
    instead of feof. (Closes: #118466)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Nov 2001 00:37:55 +0000

logrotate (3.5.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a bug I introduced in the last upload. Check that filehandles
    are non-null when you reference them. Brown paper bag time.
    (Closes: #118907,#119176)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Nov 2001 12:45:51 +0000

logrotate (3.5.7-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed rotation of /var/log/lastlog. It's a file that doesn't grow,
    and rotating it loses all the lastlog information. Perhaps making
    a backup would make more sense. (Closes: #111184)

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Tue,  4 Sep 2001 16:14:16 +0100

logrotate (3.5.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the debian/logrotate.conffiles, as debhelper v3 now

  * Loosened the config syntax checking to allow more flexibility.
    (Closes: #95617,#95630)
  * mailx is now in testing. (Closes: #67053)
  * Compile with -O2.

 -- Paul Martin <pm@debian.org>  Tue, 15 May 2001 01:59:19 +0100

  * New maintainer.

  * Changing <sys/time.h> to <time.h> in log.c fixes compiler warning.
