Description: NET SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Agents
 The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a framework
 for the exchange of management information between agents (servers)
 and clients.  The NET SNMP agent is a daemon which listens for
 incoming SNMP requests from clients and provides responses.

Description: NET SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) MIBs and Docs
 The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a framework
 for the exchange of management information between agents (servers)
 and clients.  This package includes the MIBs (Management Information
 Bases) and documentation for the the SNMP libraries, agents and
 applications.  MIBs contain a formal description of the data that can
 be managed using SNMP.  They are used by NET SNMP libraries, agents
 and applications.
