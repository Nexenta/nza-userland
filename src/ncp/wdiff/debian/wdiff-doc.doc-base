Title: GNU wdiff manual

Abstract: This manual documents GNU wdiff.
 The program `wdiff' is a front end to `diff' for comparing files on
 a word per word basis.  A word is anything between whitespace.  This is
 useful for comparing two texts in which a few words have been changed
 and for which paragraphs have been refilled.  It works by creating two
 temporary files, one word per line, and then executes `diff' on these
 files. It collects the `diff' output and uses it to produce a nicer
 display of word differences between the original files.
