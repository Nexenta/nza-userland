  * Don't remove tclsh alternative in case of package upgrade because the
    manually installed alternative is also removed which isn't desirable.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 01 Mar 2009 10:35:30 +0300

tcl8.5 (8.5.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.

  * New upstream release.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Oct 2008 12:38:13 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Restored DLL unloading for hppa and kfreebsd architectures because this
    bug was worked around in glibc.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Aug 2008 16:38:36 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Decreased priority of tclsh (and corresponding manpage) alternative
    because tcl8.4 is still a default Tcl package.
  * Disabled DLL unloading also on hppa architectures.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Jul 2008 18:21:17 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Disabled DLL unloading on kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 architectures
    because enabling it leads to segfaults on exit in threaded Tcl builds
    (closes: #488684).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Jul 2008 21:09:21 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Protected quilt calls in debian/rules to make the source package
    convertible to 3.0 (quilt) format (closes: #484915).
  * Added a patch by Stanislav Maslovski which restores relative inlude path
    for tclUnixPort.h in tclPort.h. This is harmless if unix directory is
    included into a serach path but allows to maintain backward compatibility
    (closes: #488491).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Jun 2008 12:37:40 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed clean target to work with debhelper 7.0 (made dh_clean the last

  * Moved Tcl modules to /usr/share/tcl8.5/tcl8 directory to prevent clashes
    with future tcl8.6 package.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.0.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Jun 2008 19:55:56 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Quoted CFLAGS in debian/rules when passing to the shell, not when
    assigning to a make variable; otherwise the quotes end up as part of
    the variable and many things go wrong, leading to a build failure.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 01 Apr 2008 15:10:39 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Increased priority of /usr/bin/tclsh8.5 as an alternative to
    /usr/bin/tclsh.
  * Overridden lintian warning package-name-doesnt-match-sonames since tcl8.5
    package contains not only a library, and it's unreasonable to split it
    into smaller parts.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 05 Feb 2008 20:22:44 +0300

tcl8.5 (8.5.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

tcl8.5 (0.b3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch by Miguel Sofer which fixes a bug in tclsh with
    incorrect calculation of thread stack size (closes: #452679).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Nov 2007 20:56:04 +0300

    /usr/lib to TCL_PACKAGE_PATH variable.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Nov 2007 09:00:02 +0300

  * Fixed tcl8.5-dev.preinst bug in update-alternatives call (ignore return
    value if tcl.m4 alternative doesn't exist already).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Oct 2007 06:12:42 +0400

tcl8.5 (0.b1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added -fno-unit-at-a-time option to prevent stack corruption in a
    particular use case.
  * Added /usr/local/lib/tcltk, /usr/local/share/tcltk, /usr/lib/tcltk,
    /usr/share/tcltk to auto_path variable. These directories are to be
    contain Tcl/Tk packages according to upcoming Debian Tcl/Tk Policy
    (preliminary version see at
    http://pkg-tcltk.alioth.debian.org/tcltk-policy.html/).
  * Moved architecture independent files from /usr/lib/tcl8.5 to
    /usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.5. To keep backward compatibility tclConfig.sh is
    linked to /usr/lib/tcl8.5 directory.
  * Fixed bug with update-alternatives in prerm scripts.
  * Removed conflicts with tcl and providing tcl-dev packages from
    debian/control to prepare binary packages for default tcl and tcl-dev.
  * Replaced /usr/lib by /usr/lib/tcltk in Tcl modules roots
    (TCL_MODULE_PATH).
  * Removed build-essential package from tcl8.5-dev dependencies.
  * Moved tcl.m4 to /usr/share/aclocal/tcl8.5.m4 to make it easier to use
    different versions of tcl.m4.
  * Removed alternative of tcl.m4 (the link to default tcl.m4 is to be
    maintained by tcl-dev package).
  * Rearranged conflicts of tcl8.5-doc package because of planned adoption of
    real tcl-doc package.

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]
  * Introduced Homepage field in debian/control.

    to a search path for tkConfig.sh in tcl.m4.
  * Removed hack which fixed random crashes on SMP machines (it doesn't crash
    anymore, but needs additional testing).
  * Removed patch which fixed build-failure on sparc in tclPosixStr.c since it
    is not necessary anymore.
