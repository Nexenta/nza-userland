Multiple instances of Memcached are allowed.

SMF method uses /etc/memcached.conf for default instance
and /etc/memcached.<instance>.conf for others, e. g.
/etc/memcached.test.conf for svc:/network/memcached:test.

But in any case config file can be specified in instance
property "application/config_file".

/etc/memcached.conf list options for /usr/bin/memcached
(see man memcached), -d option is ignored.
