		Using CppUnit with autotools
		----------------------------

CppUnit ships an autoconf macro that is used to detect whether the
library is available.  The usage is

  AM_PATH_CPPUNIT(MINIMUM-VERSION, [ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Note that the minimum version of CppUnit is mandatory.

In /usr/share/doc/libcppunit-doc/examples, see the files README,
configure.ac, and Makefile.am for a template to follow.
