This directory contains some examples of using CppUnit.

The test "hierarchy" is a small example, demonstrating
CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE / CPPUNIT_TEST / CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END family of
macros.  The "testResetShouldFail" test is included only to show the
output when a failure happens.  Normally one only tests for successes.

The test "cppunittestmain" is a test suite for CppUnit itself.
As you might expect, it is rather large.


You should be able to build these examples using the following
sequence of commands.

	sh setup.sh
	./configure
	make check

The CppUnit Cookbook is a good place to start -- look at
http://localhost/doc/cppunit/html/index.html.  If someone
would type in this code, I'll be happy to include it in the
next release.
