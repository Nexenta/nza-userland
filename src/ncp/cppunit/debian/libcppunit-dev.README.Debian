		Using CppUnit with autotools
		----------------------------

CppUnit ships an autoconf macro that is used to detect whether the
library is available.  The usage is

  AM_PATH_CPPUNIT(MINIMUM-VERSION, [ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

Note that the minimum version of CppUnit is mandatory.

Install package libcppunit-doc for documentation and example code.
