* Package bugs

** Unreported bugs
   These bugs should be reported via the BTS.
*** TODO Configuration files
    Rethink about the issue of configuration files.  Are we really sure that
    files in "/etc/emacs*/site-lisp.d/" should be editable by the system
    administrator?  They should probably contain only autoload code and
    defcustoms.
*** TODO (unload-feature 'tex-site)
    This new feature does not work.  Maybe preview has to be unloaded first,
    maybe the lisp startup files do not do the right thing.
*** DGMS update reportbug scripts
    The scripts should also cater for preview-latex and for the new auctex.el
    and preview.el startup files.  In particular, the md5sum of the new
    startup files should be reported.
*** TODO The uncompressed Changelog file in site-lisp/auctex
    Frank Küster: ``You install the uncompressed Changelog file in
    site-lisp/auctex, but the comment sounds as if you don't really like that.
    Wouldn't it be sufficient to store only the first lines of that file?''
    DGMS replies: ``It would probably be sufficient, but once we have
    cluttered that location I'm unsure if the need to manually update the
    Changelog file at each release is worth saving some 300kB.  Or do you
    suggest using head to select just the few N lines?  Maybe csplit would be
    the right tool, since we just (I think) have to save the first lines until
    the most recent version statement gets included (I'm also thinking about
    CVS snapshots here, so that that statement might be not in the very first
    lines).  Comments?''

** Open bugs
   These bugs should be checked to see if they still apply to the current
   release.
*** TODO #120031
*** TODO #172237
*** TODO #276102
*** TODO #290635
*** DONE #341213
    This bug can be closed, it does not apply to current AUCTeX.

** Non bugs
   These are not bugs, even if they might look like as if they were such.
*** DONE po-debconf: Fails to merge a number of translations.
    This is due to the "fuzzy" mark: fuzzy entries are not included.  On the
    other hand, fuzzy entries should really be reviewed by some translator, so
    this is ok.

** Unsettled issues
*** TODO XEmacs integration (#63513/#74702, #144846)
    XEmacs includes its own AUCTeX: if the Debian auctex package were to
    provide an upgrade, it should be careful to avoid load-path conflicts,
    both for the byte compiled files as well as for the source elisp files.
    Moreover, upstream says that there are not so many feedback by AUCTeX
    XEmacs users, and states that GNU Emacs is much better supported.  Is it
    worth to cater for XEmacs in the Debian auctex package?


* Miscellaneous stuff

** DONE Update copyright

** DONE Remove teTeX dependencies

** TODO Add some lintian override.
   auctex: extra-license-file usr/share/doc/auctex/src/copying.texi.gz
   auctex: doc-base-file-unknown-format auctex:38 texinfo
   auctex: doc-base-file-unknown-format preview-latex:11 texinfo
   auctex: executable-not-elf-or-script ./usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/auctex/install-sh
   auctex: debconf-is-not-a-registry ./usr/sbin/update-auctex-install
** TODO Lintian thingies
   auctex: malformed-prompt-in-templates auctex/doauto
   auctex: malformed-prompt-in-templates auctex/doautofg
** TODO "auctex.el", "preview-latex.el", "tex-site.el"
   Do we need those files (there)?  Wouldn't be better to move the code in
   lisp-startup?  Should those files mess with "load-path"?  Make the unload
   feature work.
** TODO .nosearch
   Do we really need "/usr/share/emacs-snapshot/site-lisp/auctex/.nosearch"?
** DGMS Patches to upstream sources
   Evaluate and discuss them with upstream developers.
** TODO /usr/sbin/update-auctex-install
   Get the proper packages (teTeX?, ...?) to use it, add perhaps a note in the
   README.Debian file.
** TODO TeX-printer-list, TeX-printer-default
   Is there any simple way to collect local printer info at installation time,
   or, even better, at load time?
