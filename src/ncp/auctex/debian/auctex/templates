_Description: (La)TeX macros parsing mode:
 To improve the performance of AUCTeX, every currently installed TeX macro
 package and LaTeX style file will be parsed.
 .
 This may take a lot of time, so it should probably be done in the
 background.  You may also choose to have it done in the foreground, or to
 skip that step.  If you choose 'Background', you will find a detailed log
 of the process in ${LOGFILE}.
 .
 A weekly cron job will also take care of updating the cached data, so that
 no specific action is required whenever you install new (La)TeX packages or
 remove old ones.
 .
 This update can be run manually at any moment by running
 'update-auctex-elisp'.
