  * debian/control:
    - Rename XS-Vcs-* fields to Vcs-* (dpkg supports them now)

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * debian/rules, debian/rsthelp2man.xsl, debian/control:
    Generate better man pages from the tools' own --help output using rst2xml
    and (new build dependency) xsltproc (Closes: #430947)
  * debian/rst2html.1: Remove, the generated man page is better
  * debian/rules, debian/unpep263.py: Mangle languages/*.py from UTF-8 into
    equivalent ASCII with \uXXXX escapes, so we can install into
    python2.x-minimal (which lacks the encodings machinery) (Closes: #379709)
  * debian/patches/15_emacs_debian_paths.dpatch, debian/patches/00list:
    In rst.el, expect executables to not have .py suffix (Closes: #438667)
  * debian/patches/16_emacs_jit_lock.dpatch, debian/patches/00list:
    Apply patch to rst.el from Justin Mazzola Paluska <jmp@MIT.EDU> to use
    jit-lock instead of lazy-lock for Emacs 22 compatibility (Closes: #418446)
  * debian/patches/00list: Actually apply 10_doc_debian_paths.dpatch, to
    improve documentation
  * debian/control: Set Homepage
  * debian/control: Move python-central from Build-Depends to
    Build-Depends-Indep to keep lintian happy; install a source override
    to stop it complaining about python-setuptools in Build-Depends, because
    we do need that package for the "clean" target
  * debian/patches/99_old-diffs.dpatch: Remove obsolete patches entirely, we
    can always retrieve them from svn if they turn out to be useful

    - Acknowledge Martin's NMU now he's a co-maintainer (closes: #315285).

      * Unquoted targets beginning with an underscore
        (.. __target: URI) are no longer accepted
      * tools/editors/emacs/rst.el changed license to GPL
      * assorted documentation changes
    * Remove patch bands consisting only of $Date$, $Revision$
  * Migrate to new Python policy, and python-central (closes: #373529).
  * Remove circular dependency during policy migration (closes: #362172).
  * Install tools as e.g. /usr/bin/rst2html only - do not install any
    executables with a .py extension, as pycentral thinks it should
    byte-compile them. Also, Policy section 10.4.
    - Install buildhtml as /usr/bin/rst-buildhtml to avoid namespace pollution.
    - Don't install quicktest.py and the "dev" tools, which appear to be
      intended for docutils developers only.
  * Move some of the documentation from /usr/share/doc/python-docutils
    to /u/s/d/p-d/docs, and compile all the documentation to HTML,
    to avoid broken hyperlinks (closes: #312305).
    - In debian/rules, tell buildhtml.py to give us the full Python
      traceback when it fails, so FTBFSs can be diagnosed.
  * Amend upstream documentation to reflect how this package installs things
    (closes: #293504). debian/patches/10_doc_debian_paths.dpatch
  * Replace all the man pages with a slightly more informative combined man
    page which gets the names right (closes: #325300, #368601).
  * Incorporate rst-mode again, hopefully. Thanks to Sylvain Ferriol for the
    patch. (Closes: #353661)
  * Move debhelper, used in debian/rules clean, from Build-Depends-Indep to
    Build-Depends, per Policy section 7.6.
  * Upgrade to debhelper compat level 5 and Policy 3.7.2.0.
  * Lintian nitpicking: Remove spurious #! line from
    docutils.readers.python.pynodes module.
    debian/patches/12_remove_unnecessary_hashbang.dpatch
  * Stop applying some optparse-related patches which appear to serve no
    purpose. Preserved as debian/patches/99_old-diffs.dpatch in case they're
    useful
