python-debian (0.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  [ James Westby ]
  * Use os.path.normpath to hide python version differences

  [ John Wright ]
  * test_deb822.py: Make test_gpg_info more robust (Closes: #582878)
  * deb822: Use chardet to try to detect character encodings as necessary
    - This is only used when the specified encoding doesn't work.  It's mainly
      useful for files containing multiple deb822 paragraphs with mixed
      encodings, like etch's Sources file. (Closes: #586021)

python-debian (0.1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian_support: Be more careful in case apt_pkg is not available
    - If apt_pkg is not available, AptPkgVersion now raises
      NotImplementedError on any initialization attempt
    - test_debian_support.py now doesn't try to test AptPkgVersion if
      apt_pkg is not available
  * test_deb822.py: Don't test gpg info if debian-keyring is not
    available (Closes: #573934)
  * Use the warnings system to report deprecation warnings

python-debian (0.1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John Wright ]
  * deb822: Don't ignore leading newlines on field data with apt_pkg
    (Closes: #466753)
  * changelog: Consistently parse different types of inputs.  The
    previous implementation added extra newlines when given a file
    object as input, rather than the result of str.splitlines().
    (Closes: #539316)
  * deb822: Faster non-shared storage by keeping a TagFile object
    around for each Deb822 object yielded

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * make debian_support.Version hashable, patch from Piotr Ożarowski
    (Closes: #543223)

  [ Filippo Giunchedi ]
  * changelog: add iterator over changelog blocks (Closes: #539334)
  * changelog: split tests into tests/test_changelog.py for consistency

  [ John Wright ]
  * deb822: Use the apt_pkg.TagFile class instead of apt_pkg.ParseTagFile()
    (Closes: #552190)
  * test_deb822.py: Update to support new gpg "SIG_ID" algorithm
  * deb822: Better support for non-ascii values.  Deb822 objects now
    always contain unicode objects instead of strings.  Use the encoding
    argument to Deb822's initializer and its iter_paragraphs class
    method if the encoding of a file you are reading in is not utf-8.
    (The dump method also takes an encoding argument, if you wish the
    output not to be utf-8-encoded.) (Closes: #495272)
  * Use the apt_pkg.TagFile iterator interface instead of hacking its
    offset.  As of python-apt version 0.7.94, that interface doesn't use
    shared storage. (Closes: #571470)
  * debian_support: Add a native python Version class, based on Raphael
    Hertzog's DpkgVersion class in the PTS (Closes: #562257, #573009)

  [ Jelmer Vernooij ]
  * Remove unused imports in the debfile and debtags modules

  [ John Wright ]
  * changelog: Use debian_support.Version directly
  * Deprecate the 'debian_bundle' package in favor of a new 'debian'
    package (Closes: #570210)
  * debian_support: split tests into tests/test_debian_support.py for
    consistency
  * Convert to "3.0 (native)" source format and update Standards-Version
    to 3.8.4 (no changes necessary)

python-debian (0.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * setup.py.in: switch to setuptools, which are able to generate eggs;
    add matching build-dep on python-setuptools (Closes: #525694)
  * examples/deb822/: add new example render-dctrl, to render packages in
    a dctrl-tools pipeline (using Markdown as long description syntax)
  * deb822: use __new__ to sub-class strings for case-insensitiveness;
    former approach is deprecated with python 2.6.
    Thanks to Loïc Minier for the patch. (Closes: #524061)

  [ Filippo Giunchedi ]
  * deb822: parse also Binary as PkgRelation, thus add .binary attribute

  [ Muharem Hrnjadovic ]
  * fixed changelog parser exception raised when dealing with empty
    changelog files (LP: #400589).

python-debian (0.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John Wright ]
  * deb822: Correctly handle deletion of keys that only exist in a pre-parsed
    dictionary

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * change naming convention to match PEP 8, with backward compatibility
    (and deprecation warnings) for all old names. Thanks to Ben Finney for
    the patch. (Closes: #489722)
  * Switch from "sha" module to "hashlib": fix a deprecation warning of
    Python 2.6. As a consequence, update pyversions to require a minimum
    of Python 2.5, which is available also in stable now. (Closes: #518427)
  * debian_support.PackageFile: allow for stanza separators made of tabs
    and spaces in addition to newlines (Closes: #501927)
  * bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no changes needed)

python-debian (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Filippo Giunchedi ]
  * Add initial support to deb822 for gpg signature checking (Closes: #485829)
  * Suggest gpgv for signature checking

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * deb822: add support for pretty printing structured inter-package
    relationships (and relevant tests)
  * debfile: add support for .tar.bz2 parts contained in .deb packages, and
    relative regression test. Thanks to Cameron Dale and Tom Parker.
    (Closes: #462859).

  [ John Wright ]
  * deb822: allow the use of unicode objects in __getitem__
  * changelog: fix the "topline" regular expression to match the one in dpkg's
    Dpkg/Changelog/Debian.pm so that it allows '.' and '+' in the distribution
    field
  * deb822: Add a use_apt_pkg parameter to Deb822.iter_paragraphs.  Now,
    callers can set use_apt_pkg=True and shared_storage=False (now the default)
    in order to take advantage of apt_pkg's speed and still be able to use
    values across iterations.  (Closes: #504413)

python-debian (0.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  [ James Westby ]
  * Allow urgency=HIGH and other words made of capital letters there, see
    fuse's changelog.
  * Allow any number of spaces before "urgency" in the header line of a
    changelog, see lvm2's changelog in Ubuntu.
  * Overhaul the parsing code to follow that used by dpkg-parsechangelog.py,
    making it much more robust.
    - There is now a "strict" option to turn warnings in to errors. It is
      on by default.
  * The file parameter in the changelog can now be a file-like object,
    to save reading a file to a string first. Thanks to Tilman Koschnick.
    (Closes: #487797)

  [ John Wright ]
  * debian/control:
    - Fix a typo in the Description field (Closes: #483688)
  * debian_bundle/deb822.py: Checksums-Sha1 and Checksums-Sha256 don't have
    section or priority subfields (Closes: #487902)

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * debian_bundle/deb822.py: add support for "parsed" dependencies and other
    inter-package relationships. See examples/deb822/depgraph for sample usage
  * examples/deb822/ add new example "depgraph"
  * tests/test_deb822.py: add tests for inter-package relationships
  * debian_bundle/debfile.py: add has_key (same implementation of
    __contains__) to better emulate dictionary containers
  * minor revamp of README pointing to deb822.py for Packages parsing and
    mentioning debfile.py
  * debian/control:
    - fix Vcs-* fields to point to the new git repository (bzr is gone)
  * bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0, no changes needed though profit of the
    possibility of wrapping Uploaders in debian/control

  [ Filippo Giunchedi ]
  * Add test case for changes file with checksums (see #487902)

 -- Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>  Wed, 06 Aug 2008 23:48:38 -0300

python-debian (0.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian_bundle/deb822.py, tests/test_deb822.py:
    - Do not cache _CaseInsensitiveString objects, since it causes case
      preservation issues under certain circumstances (Closes: #473254)
    - Add a test case
  * debian_bundle/deb822.py:
    - Add support for fixed-length subfields in multivalued fields.  I updated
      the Release and PdiffIndex classes to use this.  The default behavior for
      Release is that of apt-ftparchive, just because it's simpler.  Changing
      the behavior to resemble dak requires simply setting the
      size_field_behavior attribute to 'dak'.  (Ideally, deb822 would detect
      which behavior to use if given an actual Release file as input, but this
      is not implemented yet.)  (Closes: #473259)
    - Add support for Checksums-{Sha1,Sha256} multivalued fields in Dsc and
      Changes classes
  * debian/control:
    - "python" --> "Python" in the Description field
    - Change the section to "python"

 -- John Wright <jsw@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Apr 2008 23:58:24 -0600

python-debian (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Filippo Giunchedi ]
  * Move tests to a separate subdirectory.

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * Add examples dir for deb822 with a simple example.

  [ Adeodato Simó ]

  * Sync debian_support.py with the latest version from the secure-testing
    repository. Note that this removes support for version comparison without
    apt_pkg. (Our copy was modified in 0.1.2 to *accept* ~ in version strings,
    but comparison without apt_pkg was already broken by then.)

    Also, undo the change introduced for #431087, since we shouldn't be
    keeping incompatible versions of debian_support.py around, plus the
    desired functionality in that bug report is best provided by the deb822
    module. (Closes: #457697, #457854)

  * While rewriting the grep-maintainer example to use deb822.Packages to
    accommodate the above change, make it cope with stanzas without a
    maintainer field as well. (Closes: #457855)

  * Fix dump() method of deb822._multivalued. (Closes: #457929)

  * Small improvements to the exception handling in the grep-maintainer
    example.

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no changes needed).

python-debian (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John Wright ]
  * debian_bundle/deb822.py, debian_bundle/test_deb822.py
    - Bug fix: Allow fields with blank (empty string) values.  Previously,
      these were parsed fine, but if you tried to dump the resulting Deb822
      object, you'd get an IndexError (because of how we handled fields whose
      values start with newlines).  Added a test case.
    - Fix the copy method of Deb822Dict so that it returns an object of the
      same type, rather than explicitly instantiating Deb822Dict (so that
      subclasses like Deb822 can directly use the copy method and have it "just
      work").  Added a test case.

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * debian/control
    - mention the debfile module in the long description
    - promote Vcs-Bzr to a real field, now that dpkg supports it

python-debian (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * debfile.py
    - bugfix: make md5sums top-level method acts as a proxy instead of
      returning a method
    - bugfix: use readlines() to iterate over the md5sums file since direct
      iteration on files is available only in python >= 2.5 (closes: #438804)
    - bugfix: support spaces in filenames when accessing md5sums; thanks to
      Romain Francoise for the patch (closes: #438909)

  [ John Wright ]
  * debian/pyversions:
    - Since there are some Python 2.4-isms in this package, support only Python
      >= 2.4, rather than all versions (Closes: #438920)

 -- Stefano Zacchiroli <zack@debian.org>  Sat, 08 Sep 2007 10:12:20 +0200

python-debian (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * debfile.py
    - do not fail if extra ar members exist in a .deb, according to deb(5)
      extra ar members should be ignored (Closes: #438486). Also add the
      corresponding regression test to test_debfile.py
    - support both the (buggy) file naming scheme for TarFile of python << 2.5
      (e.g. "control") and of python >= 2.5 (e.g. "./control"). In addition,
      enable users to specify file members in three equivalent formats:
      "file", "./file", and "/file" (Closes: #438603)
  * deb822.py
    - add a deprecation warning (printed on stderr) when accessing the module
      as a top-level one; it should be rather used as "debian_bundle.deb822"

  [ John Wright ]
  * examples/debfile/ar, examples/debfile/changelog_head,
    examples/debfile/dpkg-info, examples/debfile/extract_cron:
    - Fix ImportError caused by importing modules as if they were top-level
      modules, rather than modules in the debian_bundle package
      (Closes: #438428)

python-debian (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ James Westby ]
  * changelog.py
    - Add allow_empty_author option to changelog to allow the author line
      to have no information.

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]
  * debian/control
    - joining the team: add myself as an uploader
    - add Vcs-Bzr field pointing to our Bzr repository on bzr.debian.org
  * arfile.py / debfile.py
    - new modules implementing (read-only) dpkg-deb like access to .deb
      packages; when possible, access to information contained in .deb is made
      available via other debian_bundle classes (e.g. Changelog, Deb822, ...)
    - code contributed by Stefano Zacchiroli and Filippo Giunchedi
    - corresponding examples in examples/debfile
  * debian_support.py
    - yield dictionaries instead of tuples in Packages parsing and normalize
      to lower case 822 field names (Closes: #431087)
    - no longer require a space after a ':' in RFC 822 fields; fix bogus
      parse errors of Packages-like file with PackageFile() class
  * examples/
    - added grep-maintainer example to show the Packages parsing API

  [ John Wright ]
  * debian_bundle/deb822.py, debian_bundle/test_deb822.py, deb822.py:
    - Import latest version of deb822, and create a "dummy" top-level module
      for compatibility
    - For multiline fields that start with a newline (e.g. Files in a .dsc,
      MD5Sum in Release files), the line with the "Field:" should not end in
      trailing whitespace.  Fixed and added test cases.
  * setup.py:
    - The version wasn't getting updated, so I've renamed it to setup.py.in,
      and added a __CHANGELOG_VERSION__ placeholder
  * debian/rules:
    - Generate generate setup.py from setup.py.in, filling in the version
      information from debian/changelog
    - No longer delete deb822 files
  * debian/control:
    - Add myself as an uploader
    - Add Provides, Conflicts, and Replaces fields for python-deb822
    - When describing features, mention which modules they are implemented in
  * HISTORY.deb822, debian/docs:
    - Install old changelog for deb822 as
      /usr/share/doc/python-debian/HISTORY.deb822
  * debian_bundle/changelog.py:
    - Accept numbers, '+', and '.' in the distribution field, to match dpkg's
      behavior

python-debian (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ James Westby ]
  * changelog.py
    - Add max_blocks parameter to Changelog constructor. This limits the
      number of blocks that will be parsed to that number. If you only need
      the latest entry then pass max_blocks=1 and you will only have one
      block. This is also useful to avoid trying to parse old changelog
      entries that don't follow the current format. (Closes: #429357)

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * debian_bundle/changelog.py: don't fail if a changelog block is not

python-debian (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ James Westby ]
  * debian_support.py
    - Support ~ in version numbers when python-apt is not installed.
  * Turn on the testsuites of changelog.py, and debtags.py in the build.
  * debtags.py
    - Rename with to with_ to avoid a warning on python2.5 as with will be
      a keyword in 2.6. (Closes: #409333)
  * Suggest python-apt and mention why in the README.

  [Reinhard Tartler]
  * Fix the regex matching the end line of a debian/changelog. Using
    improved regex contributed by Francois-Denis Gonthier, thanks!
    (Closes: #410880)
  * disable python_support.py testrun, it is missing in the branch.

python-debian (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ John Wright ]
  * changelog.py:
    - Version class:
      + Subclass debian_support.Version, for rich comparison
      + Changing any attribute now automatically updates any other affected
        attribute (i.e. changing full_version will update all of the other
        attributes; changing debian_version will update full_version)
    - Changelog class:
      + Many "getter" and "setter" methods were replaced with properties (so
        they appear as regular object attributes).  Most set_* methods remain
        for compatibility, and they're the actual set methods for the
        properties anyway.  Please see README.changelog.
      + You can now assign a string to the version attribute, and it will be
        coerced into a Version object

  [ James Westby ]
  * changelog.py:
    - Added a method to write the changelog to an open file.
    - Allow single digit day with no extra space in the endline of a
      changelog. Hopefully this wont allow things to be parsed that will
      be rejected by the more important tools. It does allow more files
      to be parsed and used, and I'm not entirely sure what is right.
    - Allow uppercase characters in the version number when parsing
      changelogs. Thanks to Jelmer Vernooij for the report and the fix.
  * README.changelog:
    - Update the documentation to reflect the changes mentioned above
  * Add debian/NEWS to warn of the API changes.

  [ Enrico Zini ]
  * debtags.py:
    - Added various methods after the work on the inferrer of tag
      relationships
    - Added tagminer and pkgwalk examples
