python-debian (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release includes an API incompatible change to changelog.py, sorry for
  this. The previous behaviour was broken though, and the change fixes that
  as well as being a cleaner API as well.

  The change is that most methods of Changelog (and Version) are now
  properties. If you are using them and you get an error message on update
  from a line something like

     version = changelog.full_version()

  or many of the other methods, then you can just delete the parentheses from
  the end of the line, and access the property instead.

  The other change is that Version objects are now immutable. If you were
  using the mutable behaviour then I apologise, but the code was broken. If 
  you would like mutable objects let me know and I will code up the changes
  necessary.

  As always details of how to use the model are in README.changelog.
