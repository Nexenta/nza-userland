make-dfsg (3.81-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU ack.  double free or corruption bug on file globbing, 419190. 
  * Bug fix: "make: Directory Search for Link Libraries does not look in
    /usr/local/lib", thanks to Daniel Barlow.  In the Debian binaries,
    PREFIX is /usr and thus this searches /lib,  /usr/lib and /usr/lib
    again and therefore misses any libraries that  are not packaged and
    were installed by the site admin.  The ideal behaviour would be to
    have the search path set by a Makefile variable (other than the VPATH
    blunt object) but even absent that, it would be more useful if it
    looked in /usr/local/lib even though make itself hasn't been installed
    in the /usr/local tree.                          Closes: Bug#288592

make (3.80-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "FTBFS: DVI file cannot be opened", thanks to Matt Kraai. It
    seemed odd to me that the buildd's do not seem to have a problem. On
    investigation, if one does an apt-get source make,
    ./config/texinfo.tex is still there: merely removing it from my
    working tree does not remove it from the unpacked, patched source
    tree, since diff merely ignores file deletions. I worked for me, since
    the file was actually gone from my working dir; it worked on buildd's,
    since they never remake the arch independent parts. So, now we
    aggressively delete ./config/texinfo.tex all through the build and
    clean process.                                          (Closes: #334953).

make (3.80-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version with various bugs fixed.
  * This bug was forwarded back to make, but make had already been
    fixed. In the new version, this has been fixed for real, as opposed to
    just having a workaround.                                closes: Bug#160174
  * depend on coreutils rather than the deprecated fileutils closes: Bug#161449
  * The new release also fixes this bug.          closes: Bug#144306, Bug#80783
  
    * A new feature exists: order-only prerequisites.  These prerequisites
      affect the order in which targets are built, but they do not impact
      the rebuild/no-rebuild decision of their dependents.  That is to say,
      they allow you to require target B be built before target A, without
      requiring that target A will always be rebuilt if target B is updated.
      Patch for this feature provided by Greg McGary <greg@mcgary.org>.

    * For compatibility with SysV make, GNU make now supports the peculiar
      syntax $$@, $$(@D), and $$(@F) in the prerequisites list of a rule.
      This syntax is only valid within explicit and static pattern rules: it
      cannot be used in implicit (suffix or pattern) rules.  Edouard
      G. Parmelan  <egp@free.fr> provided a patch implementing this
      feature; however, I decided to implement it in a different way.

    * The argument to the "ifdef" conditional is now expanded before it's
      tested, so it can be a constructed variable name.

      Similarly, the arguments to "export" (when not used in a variable
      definition context) and "unexport" are also now expanded.

    * A new function is defined: $(value ...).  The argument to this
      function is the _name_ of a variable.  The result of the function is
      the value of the variable, without having been expanded.

    * A new function is defined: $(eval ...).  The arguments to this
      function should expand to makefile commands, which will then be
      evaluated as if they had appeared in the makefile.  In combination
      with define/endef multiline variable definitions this is an extremely
      powerful capability.  The $(value ...) function is also sometimes
      useful here.

    * A new built-in variable is defined, $(MAKEFILE_LIST).  It contains a
      list of each makefile GNU make has read, or started to read, in the
      order in which they were encountered.  So, the last filename in the
      list when a makefile is just being read (before any includes) is the
      name of the current makefile.

    * A new built-in variable is defined: $(.VARIABLES).  When it is
      expanded it returns a complete list of variable names defined by all
      makefiles at that moment.

    * A new command-line option is defined, -B or --always-make.  If
      specified GNU make will consider all targets out-of-date even if they
      would otherwise not be.

    * The arguments to $(call ...) functions were being stored in $1, $2,
      etc. as recursive variables, even though they are fully expanded
      before assignment.  This means that escaped dollar signs ($$ etc.)
      were not behaving properly.  Now the arguments are stored as simple
      variables.  This may mean that if you added extra escaping to your
      $(call ...) function arguments you will need to undo it now.

    * The variable invoked by $(call ...) can now be recursive: unlike other
      variables it can reference itself and this will not produce an error
      when it is used as the first argument to $(call ...) (but only then).

    * New pseudo-target .LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME, superseding the configure
      option --disable-nsec-timestamps.  You might need this if your build
      process depends on tools like "cp -p" preserving time stamps, since
      "cp -p" (right now) doesn't preserve the subsecond portion of a time
      stamp.

    * Updated translations for French, Galician, German, Japanese, Korean,
      and Russian.  New translations for Croatian, Danish, Hebrew, and
      Turkish.

    * Updated internationalization support to Gettext 0.11.5.
      GNU make now uses Gettext's "external" feature, and does not include
      any internationalization code itself.  Configure will search your
      system for an existing implementation of GNU Gettext (only GNU Gettext
      is acceptable) and use it if it exists.  If not, NLS will be disabled.
      See ABOUT-NLS for more information.

    * Updated to autoconf 2.54 and automake 1.7.  Users should not be impacted.

    invoked. Thus the behaviour displayed is not a bug       closes: Bug#119663
  * All variable and function expansion for targets and prerequisite lists
    occurs when the makefile is read in, well before any sort of pattern
    expansion occurs; so these functions are operating on the static
    string "%", not the string it will expand to after pattern matching.

    * .SECONDARY with no prerequisites now prevents any target from being

       listed in the makefile.
    * New configure option --disable-nsec-timestamps will keep make from
      using sub-second timestamps on systems which support it.  If your
      build process depends on proper timestamp-preserving behavior of tools
      like "cp -p" you might need this option, since "cp -p" (right now)
      doesn't preserve the sub-second portion of the timestamp.

make (3.79-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, adds fixes already present in Debian. This
    closes: Bug#62619
    changes are: 
     * GNU make optionally supports internationalization and locales via
       the GNU gettext (or local gettext if suitable) package.  See the
       ABOUT-NLS file for more information on configuring GNU make for
       NLS.  
     * Previously, GNU make quoted variables such as MAKEFLAGS and
       MAKEOVERRIDES for proper parsing by the shell.  This allowed them to
       be used within make build scripts.  However, using them there is not
       proper behavior: they are meant to be passed to subshells via the
       environment.  Unfortunately the values were not quoted properly to be
       passed through the environment.  This meant that make didn't properly
       pass some types of command line values to submakes.
   
       With this version we change that behavior: now these variables are
       quoted properly for passing through the environment, which is the
       correct way to do it.  If you previously used these variables
       explicitly within a make rule you may need to re-examine your use for
       correctness given this change.     
     * A new psuedo-target .NOTPARALLEL is available.  If defined, the
       current makefile is run serially regardless of the value of -j.
       However, submakes are still eligible for parallel execution.
     * The --debug option has changed: it now allows optional flags
       controlling the amount and type of debugging output.  By default only
       a minimal amount information is generated, displaying the names of
       "normal" targets (not makefiles) were deemed out of date and in need
       of being rebuilt.
     
       Note that the -d option behaves as before: it takes no arguments and
       all debugging information is generated.     
     * The `-p' (print database) output now includes filename and linenumber
       information for variable definitions, to help debugging.
     * The wordlist function no longer reverses its arguments if the "start"
       value is greater than the "end" value.  If that's true, nothing is
       returned.
     * Hartmut Becker provided many updates for the VMS port of GNU make.
       See the readme.vms file for more details.

make (3.77-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Excerpted changes:
    * Implement BSD make's "?=" variable assignment operator.  The variable
      is assigned the specified value only if that variable is not already
      defined.
    * Make defines a new variable, "CURDIR", to contain the current working
      directory (after the -C option, if any, has been processed).
      Modifying this variable has no effect on the operation of make.
    * Make defines a new default RCS rule, for new-style master file
      storage: ``% :: RCS/%'' (note no ``,v'' suffix).
    
      Make defines new default rules for DOS-style C++ file naming
      conventions, with ``.cpp'' suffixes.  All the same rules as for
      ``.cc'' and ``.C'' suffixes are provided, along with LINK.cpp and
      COMPILE.cpp macros (which default to the same value as LINK.cc and
      COMPILE.cc).  Note CPPFLAGS is still C preprocessor flags!  You should
      use CXXFLAGS to change C++ compiler flags.
    * A new feature, "target-specific variable values", has been added.
      This is a large change so please see the appropriate sections of the
      manual for full details.  Briefly, syntax like this:
    
         TARGET: VARIABLE = VALUE
    
      defines VARIABLE as VALUE within the context of TARGET.  This is
      similar to SunOS make's "TARGET := VARIABLE = VALUE" feature.  Note
      that the assignment may be of any type, not just recursive, and that
      the override keyword is available.
    
      COMPATIBILITY: This new syntax means that if you have any rules where
      the first or second dependency has an equal sign (=) in its name,
      you'll have to escape them with a backslash: "foo : bar\=baz".
      Further, if you have any dependencies which already contain "\=",
      you'll have to escape both of them: "foo : bar\\\=baz".
    * A new appendix listing the most common error and warning messages
      generated by GNU make, with some explanation, has been added to the
      GNU make User's Manual.
    * Updates to the GNU make Customs library support (see README.customs).
    * Updates to the Windows 95/NT port from Rob Tulloh (see README.W32),
      and to the DOS port from Eli Zaretski (see README.DOS).

  * With Stellar help from Stephen Zander <srz@mckesson.com>, changed the
    aclocal.m4 file (already present in the upstream sources) to override
    the function that checks for libelf. This should now not create a
    spurious dependency on libelfg0 even if the gremlins cause automake to
    be run to recreate configure.

make (3.76-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream update. Changes:
       * GNU make now uses automake to control Makefile.in generation.  This
         should make it more consistent with the GNU standards.
       * VPATH functionality has been changed to incorporate the VPATH+ patch,
         previously maintained by Paul Smith <psmith@baynetworks.com>.  See the
         manual.
       * Make defines a new variable, `MAKECMDGOALS', to contain the goals that
         were specified on the command line, if any.  Modifying this variable
         has no effect on the operation of make.
       * A new function, `$(wordlist S,E,TEXT)', is available: it returns a
         list of words from number S to number E (inclusive) of TEXT.
       * Instead of an error, detection of future modification times gives a
         warning and continues.  The warning is repeated just before GNU make
         exits, so it is less likely to be lost.
       * Fix the $(basename) and $(suffix) functions so they only operate on
         the last filename, not the entire string:
             Command              Old Result             New Result
             -------              ----------             ----------
           $(basename a.b)        a                      a
           $(basename a.b/c)      a                      a.b/c
           $(suffix a.b)          b                      b
           $(suffix a.b/c)        b/c                    <empty>
       * The $(strip) function now removes newlines as well as TABs and spaces.
       * The $(shell) function now changes CRLF (\r\n) pairs to a space as well
         as newlines (\n).
       * Updates to the Windows 95/NT port from Rob Tulloh (see README.W32).
       * Eli Zaretskii has updated the port to 32-bit protected mode on MSDOS
         and MS-Windows, building with the DJGPP v2 port of GNU C/C++ compiler
         and utilities.  See README.DOS for details, and direct all questions
         concerning this port to Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il> or DJ
         Delorie <dj@delorie.com>.
       * John W. Eaton has updated the VMS port to support libraries and VPATH.
  * Make sure that the manual pages are installed.
