boost1.39 (1.39.0-4) unstable; urgency=low
  
  Since only one (the multi-threaded) variant of each library is built,
  upstream elected to simplify the library name by removing the
  redundant "-mt" decoration.  Debian will follow this convention, to
  remain compatible at link time with other vendors.  The preferred form
  of the link option is now "-lboost_regex", etc.
  
  In response to the Debian 1.37 package, a number of boost-using
  packages changed their build system to add "-mt"; see entry below.  To
  avoid breaking all these packages, Debian is providing compatibility
  symlinks with the "-mt" decoration; e.g. "-lboost_regex-mt" continues
  to work.  However, note that this name is not compatible with other
  distributions, so build-system authors are encouraged to use the
  undecorated name.

boost1.37 (1.37.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  The single-threaded variant of the libraries is no longer built.
  Prior to this, -lboost_regex was the single-threaded variant and
  -lboost_regex-mt was the multi-threaded variant of Boost.Regex.  Any
  software using "-lboost_regex" will need to now use "-lboost_regex-mt"
  instead (and similar for all other libraries, of course).

boost1.35 (1.35.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  All packages now incorporate the boost version.  The -doc, -dbg, and
  -dev packages are labelled with 1.35 under the assumption that 1.35.x
  will all be API compatible.  The shared lib packages are labelled with
  the SOVERSION (1.35.0) as always.  The new packages conflict with the
  old (versions 1.34.x) since they install into the same directories.
  The new packages have a new source name, however, so both 1.34 and
  1.35 will be available from the Debian repository.
  
  Removed package bcp.  The binary "bcp" is now found in libboost-dev.

  Removed package pyste.  The binary "pyste" is now found in
  libboost-python-dev.

boost (1.34.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  The boost library short name has changed semantics in Debian.  Prior to
  1.34.0-1, the short name was multi-threaded.  Now it is single
  threaded.

  Boost library names encode the SOVERSION and build characteristics of
  the library, including the compiler used (gcc41) and whether
  multi-threading is enabled (-mt if so).  This leads to long names like
  libboost_wserialization-gcc42-mt-1_34_1.so.1.34.1
  [http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html#library-naming]
  that are hard to discover in the build system of boost-using software.

  Prior to 1.34.0-1, Debian packages provided a NON-PORTABLE short form
  of the library name as a convenience.  The short form
  (e.g. libboost_wserialization.so) did not have the compiler or "-mt"
  strings in the name, even though it was the multi-thread flavour.

  Other distributions, e.g. Fedora, use the so-called "layout=system"
  install and also have shorter-named boost libraries.  However, the
  short-named libraries are the single-threaded flavour.  The
  multi-threaded flavour has "-mt" appended,
  e.g. libboost_wserialization-mt.so).

  After some discussion, both internal and on bug reports #429533,
  #424038, #425264, #428419, #431502, and #425992, we decided to bring
  the Debian names in line with "layout=system", hence compatible with
  other distributions.  This means that the short name has changed
  semantics from being the multi-threaded flavour to being now the
  single-threaded flavour.

  To summarize: if you're linking to libboostX for a multi-threaded
  application, append "-mt".
