.SH NAME
bcp \- extract subsets of Boost
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bcp
\fB\-\-list\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fImodule\-list\fR
.br
.B bcp
[\fIoptions\fR] \fImodule\-list output\-path\fR
.br
.B bcp
\fB\-\-report\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fImodule\-list html\-file\fR
.br
.B bcp
\fB\-\-help\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Copies all the files, including dependencies, found in \fImodule-list\fR
to \fIoutput-path\fR. \fIoutput-path\fR must be an existing path.
.PP
With \fB\-\-list\fR, prints the list of all the
files in \fImodule-list\fR, including dependencies.
.PP
With \fB\-\-report\fR, writes the HTML report to \fIhtml-file\fR.
.PP
With \fB\-\-help\fR, prints a quick usage reminder.
.PP
It is useful for Boost authors who want to distribute their library
separately from Boost and for Boost users who want to distribute a
subset of Boost with their application.
.SS \fImodule-list\fR
.PP
When the --scan option is not used, a list of Boost files or library names to copy. It can be:
.IP
\- The name of a tool: for example "build" will find "tools/build".
.IP
\- The name of a library: for example "regex".
.IP
\- The title of a header: for example "scoped_ptr" will find "boost/scoped_ptr.hpp".
.IP
\- The name of a header: for example "scoped_ptr.hpp" will find "boost/scoped_ptr.hpp".
.IP
\- The name of a file: for example "boost/regex.hpp".
.PP
When the --scan option is used, a list of (probably non-boost) files to scan for Boost dependencies, the files in the module list are not therefore copied/listed.
.SS File dependencies
C++ source files are scanned for #includes, all #includes present in the
Boost source tree will then be scanned for their dependencies and so on.
.PP
C++ source files are associated with the name of a library, if that
library has source code (and possibly build data), then include that
source in the dependencies.
.PP
C++ source files are checked for dependencies on Boost.Test (for example
to see if they use cpp_main as an entry point).
.PP
HTML files are scanned for immediate dependencies (images and style
sheets, but not links).
.SS
HTML report contains:
.PP
\- all the licenses in effect, plus the files using each license, and
the copyright holders using each license
.PP
\- any files with no recognizable license (please report these to the
Boost mailing lists)
.PP
\- any files with no recognizable copyright holders (please report these
to the Boost mailing lists)
.PP
\- all the copyright holders and the files on which they hold copyright
.PP
\- file dependency information - indicates the reason for the inclusion
of any particular file in the dependencies found
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-boost\fR=\fIpath\fR
sets the location of the Boost tree to path
.TP
\fB\-\-scan\fR
treat the module list as a list of (possibly non\-boost)
files to scan for Boost dependencies
.TP
\fB\-\-cvs\fR
only copy files under CVS version control
.TP
\fB\-\-unix\-lines\fR
make sure that all copied files use Unix style line endings
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fBbcp\fR scoped_ptr /foo
Copies boost/scoped_ptr.hpp and dependencies to /foo.
.TP
\fBbcp\fR boost/regex.hpp /foo
Copies boost/regex.hpp and all dependencies including the regex source
code (in libs/regex/src) and build files (in libs/regex/build) to /foo.
Does not copy the regex documentation, test or example code.
.TP
\fBbcp\fR regex /foo
Copies the full regex lib (in libs/regex) including dependencies (such
as the Boost.Test source required by the regex test programs) to /foo.
.TP
\fBbcp\fR regex config build /foo
Copies the full regex lib (in libs/regex) plus the config lib
(libs/config) and the build system (tools/build) to /foo including all
the dependencies.
.TP
\fBbcp \-\-scan \-\-boost\fR=/boost foo.cpp bar.cpp boost
Scans the [non-boost] files foo.cpp and bar.cpp for Boost dependencies
and copies those dependencies to the sub-directory boost.
.TP
\fBbcp \-\-report\fR regex.hpp boost-regex-report.html
Creates a HTML report called boost-regex-report.html for the Boost
module regex.hpp.
