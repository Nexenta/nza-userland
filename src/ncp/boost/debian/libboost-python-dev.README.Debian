		Multiple Python Runtime Support
		-------------------------------

The Debian Boost.Python packages support python versions: 2.4, 2.5.

This is achieved by decorating the library names with the python
version.  You can choose either to use Boost.Python with a specific
Python version, or use the default Python version.


	Choosing the default Python
	---------------------------

You may simply link with -lboost_python.  This will always be the
default python version.

These default symlinks are automatically updated when the Python
runtime version changes.


	Choosing a specific Python Version
	----------------------------------

The library names are suffixed by "-py24" and "-py25", allowing you to
select the specific Python version desired.  This holds true
for both the upstream names and the simplified Debian names.

So link against -lboost_python-py24 for Python 2.4.
