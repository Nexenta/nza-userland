  * patches/python-enum-same-value.patch: New.  Support enums with
    duplicated values.  Closes: #523343.
  
  * rules: Build using --layout=system, and only the variants normally
    built by upstream default (1 shared and 1 static variant).  System
    layout no longer has any decoration; i.e., neither -mt nor -mt-d.  Use
    bootstrap.sh to build bjam and configure boost; use "bjam install" to
    install all files into debian/tmp.  Bootstrap creates the file
    project-config.jam including a line naming the default python, so
    remove rule to add the default python to user-config.jam; add only
    non-default versions of python.
  
  * libboost-dbg.postinst.in:
  * libboost-dbg.prerm.in: Remove.  No longer shipping "-d" variants of
    libboost_python in /usr/lib, so don't need to call rtupdate for
    libboost-dbg.
  
  * rtupdate: There is no longer separate single and multi-threaded
    libraries to take care of.
  
  * debian/quickbook.1:
  * debian/inspect.1: New.  Manpages for installed tools.

  * control: Set Standards-Version to 3.8.2; no changes required.  Make
    -dbg depend on -dev.  Add non-virtual alternative for -dev dependency
    on libstdc++-dev.
  
  * copyright: Add the Caramel license, used by boostbook.

    Closes: #529258, #529622.  Add Replaces and Provides for "bcp" since the contents
    of that package is now provided in -dev.

  * control: Add build-conflict against boost-build;
    otherwise bjam fails with diagnostic "duplicate initialization of gcc ..."
    because both /etc/site-config.jam and ./user-config.jam have
    "using gcc" lines.  

  * patches/boost-python-examples.patch: New.  Patch example Jamroot to
    use installed libboost_python (thanks, Georg Schmid).  
    Closes: #452410.
  
  * rules: Set OMPI_MCA_disable_memory_allocator=1 to work around bad
    interaction between fakeroot and OpenMPI.  Closes: #531415.

  * libboost-doc.README.Debian: Explain how to build Boost.Python
    examples.

  * debian/rules: Do not build bjam with CC=gcc-4.1.
  * debian/control: Do not build-depend on gcc-4.1.  Closes: #463287.

  * debian/control: Change Build-Depends from "python-dev |
    python-all-dev, python2.4-dev" to simply "python-all-dev"; this brings
    in all current Python -dev packages.  Update python-support required
    version from 0.3 to 0.6, following README of current python-support
    package.  Remove "python2.4-dev" from dependency of
    libboost-python-dev; add python2.4-dev and python2.5-dev to its
    Suggests line since users of this package may need any of the
    currently-supported Python development packages.
  * debian/rules: Introduce a suffix on library names, intended to handle
    the -py24 and -py25 suffices added using --buildid.  This requires
    some new functions, and updates to existing functions: mk_base_name,
    mk_full_name, mk_compat_name, mk_xxx_files, mk_files, and
    mk_debhelper_files.  Add lines for Python 2.4 and 2.5 to
    user-config.jam file and build each python version explicitly.  Factor
    code to remove generated debhelper files from clean to new rule
    clean-debhelper, called from both clean and install rules.  Install
    debian/rtupdate files, ensure the -py24 and -py25 libraries are
    installed and remove those without suffices.  Remove unnecessary use
    of dh_python.  Closes: #445381, #425881, #466820.
