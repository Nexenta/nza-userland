jade and sp for Debian
----------------------

This document covers the Debian version of Jade and the SP suite.
Note that we use the version of SP which ships with the Jade sources,
which is slightly newer than the SP which ship standalone.

Note that the default search paths compiled into this system are
equivalent to setting the following environment variables as shown:

 SGML_CATALOG_FILES="%{default-catalogs}"
 SGML_SEARCH_PATH="%{default-sgml-path}"

You can override this by setting these variables yourself, i.e., in
~/.profile or /etc/environment.

If you are validating or processing XML, you want to run the command
with the XML declaration.  The upstream documentation talks about
xml.soc, which is located in %{sgmldir}/declaration/xml.soc, 
but you can also run it like so:
  nsgmls <other-args> %{sgmldir}/declaration/xml.dcl <xml-file>
or
  jade <other-args> %{sgmldir}/declaration/xml.dcl <xml-file>
as appropriate.

For information on using these packages, see the included HTML
documentation.  It also includes links to other sites, for more
information about SGML or DSSSL.  Also see:

James Clark, the upstream maintainer, is now quite absorbed in the XSL
effort, which is an XML alternative to DSSSL.  However, a new group
has undertaken to continue to improve and maintain Jade under the name
OpenJade.  This software is not yet released, but they have already
produced some documentation, etc.  See
<URL:http://www.netfolder.com/DSSSL/>.

No package is an island; true to this dictum, the jade and sp packages
increase value in conjunction with the following packages:

  * sgml-base (required) provides essential Debian SGML infrastructure
  * sgml-data (suggested) contains standard HTML and entities
  * doc-base (suggested) provides documentation infrastructure used for
    this package's documentatation
  * sp-dev		Static library and include files for SP
  * jadetex		LaTeX macros for SGML to DVI/PS conversion with jade
  * psgml		Nifty Emacs mode for editing SGML documents
  * sdc			SDC is an alternate SGML formatter not using DSSSL
  * debiandoc-sgml	A formatter for Debian documents
  * sgml-tools		A formatter for linuxdoc documents
  * docbook		An SGML DTD for software documentation
  * docbook-stylesheets	Stylesheets for printing and converting DocBook
