.TH "SGMLNORM" "1" "05 July 1999" "SP" ""
.SH NAME
sgmlnorm \- normalize SGML documents
.sp
An SGML System Conforming to
International Standard ISO 8879 --
Standard Generalized Markup Language
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsgmlnorm\fR [ \fB-Cdemnv\fR ]  [ \fB-b\fIbctf\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-c\fIcatalog\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-D\fIdir\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-i\fIname\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-w\fIwarning\fB\fR ]  \fB\fIsysid\fB\fR\fI...\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsgmlnorm\fR prints on the standard output a
\fBnormalized\fR document instance for the SGML document contained
in the concatenation of the entities with system identifiers
\fIsysid...\fR
.PP
When the normalized instance is prefixed with the original SGML declaration
and prolog, it will have the same ESIS as the original SGML document,
with the following exceptions:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The output of sgmlnorm does not protect against the
recognition of short reference delimiters, so any USEMAP
declarations must be removed from the DTD.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The normalized instance will use the reference
delimiters, even if the original instance did not.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If marked sections are included in the output using
the \fB-m\fR option, the reference reserved names will be used for
the status keywords even if the original instance did not. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Any ESIS information relating to the SGML LINK feature
will be lost. 
.PP
The normalized instance will not use any markup minimization features
except that:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Any attributes that were not specified in the original instance
will not be included in the normalized instance.
(Current attributes will be included.)
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If the declared value of an attribute was a name token
group, and a value was specified that was the same as the name of the
attribute, then the attribute name and value indicator will be omitted.
For example, with HTML \fBsgmlnorm\fR would output 
<DL COMPACT> rather than 
<DL COMPACT="COMPACT">.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-b\fIbctf\fB\fR
Use the BCTF name \fIbctf\fR for output. 
See \fBnsgmls\fR(1) for more information about this option.
.TP
\fB-c\fIfile\fB\fR
Use the catalog entry file
\fIfile\fR. 
.TP
\fB-C\fR
The \fIfilename...\fR arguments specify catalog files rather
than the document entity. The document entity is specified by the first
DOCUMENT entry in the catalog files.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Output a document type declaration with the same external
identifier as the input document, and with no
internal declaration subset.
No check is performed that the document instance is valid
with respect to this DTD.
.TP
\fB-D\fIdirectory\fB\fR
Search \fIdirectory\fR for files specified in system
identifiers. Multiple \fB-D\fR options are allowed. See \fBnsgmls\fR(1)
for more information about this option.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
Describe open entities in error messages.
.TP
\fB-i\fIname\fB\fR
Pretend that
<!ENTITY % name "INCLUDE">
occurs at the start of the document type declaration subset in the SGML
document entity. Since repeated definitions of an entity are ignored,
this definition will take precedence over any other definitions of this
entity in the document type declaration. Multiple \fB-i\fR options
are allowed. If the SGML declaration replaces the reserved name
INCLUDE then the new reserved name will be the replacement
text of the entity. Typically the document type declaration will
contain
<!ENTITY % name "IGNORE">
and will use %name; in the status keyword specification of a
marked section declaration. In this case the effect of the option will
be to cause the marked section not to be ignored.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Output any marked sections that were in the input document instance.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Output any comments that were in the input document instance.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Raw output.
Don't perform any conversion on RSs and REs when printing the entity.
The entity would typically have the storage manager attribute
records=asis.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print the version number.
.TP
\fB-w\fItype\fB\fR
Control warnings and errors according to
\fItype\fR. 
See \fBnsgmls\fR(1) for the allowed values of type.
