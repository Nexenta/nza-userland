jade (1.2.1-47) unstable; urgency=low

  * "Package explicitely build-depends on g++-3.4":
    debian/control: Remove dependency on g++ 3.4 for hppa, 4.0 works.
    debian/rules: Use -O2 for hppa as well as other arches.
   (closes: #342972)
  * Removed debian/watch.  We do not want a newer version even if one
    comes out because Jade has been replaced by OpenJade.  The last
    upstream release of Jade was over seven years ago. (closes: #354368)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Feb 2006 18:00:28 -0500

jade (1.2.1-46) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Fix quoting on multiline sed command to fix make
    backward incompatibility: "FTBFS with new make". Also fixed
    README.Debian.in: sgml-dir -> sgmldir.  Thanks to Daniel
    Schepler. (closes: #346185)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Jan 2006 06:46:18 -0500

jade (1.2.1-45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove bogus libstdc++6-4.0-dev and libc6-dev depedencies, thanks to
    Matthias Klose. (closes: #320445)
  * Removed unnecessary libtool and gettext dependencies.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.6.2 - no changes to package.
  * Moved debian/libsp1.* to debian/libsp1c2.* - should have been done in
    the last version.
  * Build using g++-3.4 on hppa to avoid FTBFS, thanks to Matthias
    Klose. (closes: #321084)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Aug 2005 22:38:32 -0400

jade (1.2.1-44) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes for using g++ 4.0:
  - Use patch supplied by Daniel Schepler to allow it to compile.
    (closes: #308810).
  - Updated version numbers in Replaces and Conflicts so that all SP libs
    as well as Jade are consistent.
  - Updated C++ lib to libstdc++6-4.0-dev.
  - Changed name from libsp1 to libsp1c2.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jul 2005 21:19:42 -0400

jade (1.2.1-43) unstable; urgency=high

  * RC bug fix: Make libsp1 conflict with jade earlier than 1.2.1-30 to
    avoid problem where old version of jade fails to run because of
    changes in libsp1.  Better way to do this would be new soname, etc.,
    but that would be a drastic change to make so close to the sarge
    release (this situation has existed for almost two years with no prior
    report of problems). Other, non-Debian programs compiled locally
    against old version of libsp1 might have problems.  Best solution for
    those is to convert to the OpenSP version of these programs, since
    that is the successor to this old, no longer updated suite of
    programs. (closes: #286945)
  * Use patch supplied by Andreas Jochens to allow compiling with g++ 3.4
    (closes: #221735, #270109)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Dec 2004 07:12:29 -0500

jade (1.2.1-42) unstable; urgency=low

jade (1.2.1-41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rerun libtool with newer version to fix build on mips (closes: #252313)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Jun 2004 20:59:29 -0400

jade (1.2.1-40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed /usr/lib/sgml and /usr/local/lib/sgml.
  * Added dh-buildinfo.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Wed, 19 May 2004 22:54:22 -0400

jade (1.2.1-39) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Changed default-catalogs from a list of absolute paths
    that was a duplicate of default-sgml-path to just "/etc/sgml/catalog".
    A file called "catalog" will be searched for on all directories in
    default-sgml-path, so the only one that needs to be explicitly
    specified is /etc/sgml/catalog, since /etc/sgml is not in
    default-sgml-path, and does not need to be.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Dec 2003 07:51:29 -0500

jade (1.2.1-38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert to -35 behavior of using gruesome sed hack to force libtool to
    use C++ for linking.  The newer libtool only cures the problem if the
    autotools generated files are regenerated, and they were not (oops).
    They are very old and I do not want to open an autotools can of worms
    just as we are about to release sarge, so sed it is for now.  Fixes
    "libsp1: Libraries contain undefined symbols" from Robin Verduijn
    (closes: #220067).

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Nov 2003 08:25:41 -0500

jade (1.2.1-37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to policy version 3.6.1 (no changes).
  * Depend on debhelper >= 4.1.75 to pick up necessary fixes to
    dh_installcatalogs.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Oct 2003 21:51:56 -0400

jade (1.2.1-36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed all explicit g++ dependencies.
  * Removed gruesome sed hack used to get libtool to use C++ for linking,
    libtool 1.5 now does this properly.
  * Removed creation of unused /usr/lib/jade.
  * Updated jade.{prerm,postinst} to conform to current practice.
  * Change reference from copying.txt to copyright in jade
    documentation. (closes: #186884)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Oct 2003 18:27:35 -0400

jade (1.2.1-35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed use of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to conform to policy:
    - set -g by default instead of -O2
    - add -O2 if "noopt" is present, else -O0
    - remove addition of -g if "debug" is present.
     (closes: #199078)
  * Explicitly depend on g++ 3.3 on m68k so it works even if built on a
    buildd running an old compiler (closes: #199013)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jul 2003 22:18:21 -0400

jade (1.2.1-34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use g++ 3.3 on m68k, it works now, and 2.95 doesn't. (closes: #196730)
  * Build depend on m4, not automake1.5; latter unnecessary.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Jun 2003 07:05:54 -0400

jade (1.2.1-33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified debian/rules to use g++-3.2 on s390; there is a compiler
    problem with 3.3 (closes: #195902)
  * Changed section of libsp1-dev to libdevel to match override file.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Wed,  4 Jun 2003 12:39:30 -0400

jade (1.2.1-32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reordered definitions of classes in Attribute.h to resolve compile
    errors when using g++ 3.3.
  * Added command to debian/rules to change permissions on m4 files so
    that they can be touch(1)-ed during build.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sat, 24 May 2003 16:36:10 -0400

jade (1.2.1-31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing build-depends on autotools-dev.
  * Quoted "remove" in libsp1.postrm to eliminate lintian warning.
  * Converted to automake1.5.
  * Forced all compilation and libtool to use g++ so that libstdc++ gets
    properly linked into the shared libraries. (closes: #193950)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Wed, 21 May 2003 16:38:35 -0400

  * policy compliant to 3.5.6
  * debian/rules: more debhelperification, suggestions from Roger Leigh
  * move to DH_COMPAT 3, require debhelper 3.0 or better
  * debian/control: add build-depends on gettext, remove redundant dependency
    on autotools-dev
  * provide FOT.tex as an example, I guess that's for an example of how to
    render FOT output -- not completely clear...
  * we provide xml.soc in /usr/share/sgml/declaration/xml.soc, as expected
    by psgmls and probably other tools

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Nov 2001 20:35:50 -0500

jade (1.2.1-23) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: touch the m4 files in the clean rule, forcing them to
    rebuild, as Gerhard Tonn pointed out (my CVS makes all the timestamps
    the same)
  * refresh config.status etc files again, not that it really matters,
    since those are also forced during build
  * configure.in: force AC_PROG_CXXCPP early, preventing a little annoying
    problem
  * fix a duplicate dependancy on libsp1 affecting jade and sp
  * libsp1, policy: should call ldconfig in the `postrm' script if the
    first argument is `remove'; rework the 'ldconfig' call in postinst so
    lintian likes it better (although it was perfectly correct before)
  * debian/rules: we were building before on alpha and ia64 with
    SIZEOF_SIZE_T forced to 8; that isn't necessary anymore since we've
    hopefully fixed the upstream source to no longer need this
  * debian/rules: implement policy recommendations regarding
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS

jade (1.2.1-21) unstable; urgency=medium

    being misused, this eliminates some tomfoolery in debian/rules
  * debian/rules: clean is a bit cleaner
  * update config.{sub,guess}, autoconf and libtool stuff in the source
  * Makefile.in: fix a mixup with the whole .libs symlink stuff, oh why

jade (1.2.1-19) unstable; urgency=medium

    or alpha, where sizeof long != sizeof int I think?)
    closes: #97949, #103192, #109388

    could someone who knows C++ please do this right and/or take over this
    package please?  WNPP request already submitted.
  
  * TODO file: cosmetics, note need to do new sgml-base policy
  * rerun libtoolize --force, although I rather fail to see how this
    makes much difference for porters, since running libtoolize --force is
    part of the build process (I moved it up even higher); closes: #97377
  * in new libstdc++3, we need SP_NO_STD_NAMESPACE enabled; closes: #96261

jade (1.2.1-16) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * patch for Alpha (and 64-bit arches) (closes: Bug#58666);
    comment from the bug fixer, David Huggins-Daines:
      work around broken C++ compiler on Alpha, also instantiate
      Vector<size_t> on Alpha since sizeof(size_t) != sizeof(int). This
      can't be done on 32-bit archs since gcc 2.95 will complain about
      multiple instantiations, however it has to be done on 64-bit ones -
      this is just a quick hack, upstream needs to fix it by checking the
      size of size_t in their configure script.
  * since the preceeding fix is needed for Alpha compilation, and since
    that patch does not affect any other architectures, this should be
    included in Potato.

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Apr 1999 18:19:28 -0400

jade (1.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * parameterize and change default SGML paths to put /usr/local paths
    prior to /usr paths; automatically populate README.Debian with the
    proper value (closes Bug#31737)

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Feb 1999 18:01:32 -0500

jade (1.2.1-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: cosmetic cleanups
  * debian/rules: recompile the whole shbang with -D_REENTRANT (policy
    violation for libraries -- hopefully it won't hurt the non-libraries)

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Dec 1998 01:49:51 -0500

jade (1.2.1-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * recompile with new g++/libstdc++
  * maintainer name change
  * debian/control: fix spelling error in description (thanks, lintian!)
  * debian/control: standards version 2.5.0

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Nov 1998 06:29:49 -0500

jade (1.2.1-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: libsp1 conflicts with sp (<= 1.3-1.1-6), since if jade
    is run with the mentioned or earlier sp, there are problems with the
    shared libraries (closes Bug#29423)

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Nov 1998 02:28:26 -0500

jade (1.2.1-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream minor version, bugfixes only, including portability fixes 
    and an autoconf bug which stopped the MIF backend from really being
    enabled
  * pristine upstream source
  * config/configure.in: stop forcing us to use -ansi, which should help
    porters, and is more correct -- consulting upstream with Cees de
    Groot.   Should close Bug#28176.

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Oct 1998 02:46:32 -0400

jade (1.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control: jade suggests sp
  * debian/control: jade depends on libsp1 (closes Bug#28031, Bug#27830)

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Oct 1998 10:00:50 -0400

jade (1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * enable MIF backend
  * sp properly depends on libsp1 -- either dpkg-shlibdeps let me down or
    I'm using it wrong (closes Bug#27331)
  * debian/rules: set LD_PRELOAD= to work around bad interaction between 
    fakeroot and dpkg-shlibdeps; ensure autoconf scripts are executable;
    fixup some strictly internal stuff

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Oct 1998 20:26:26 -0400

jade (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version, obsoletes all previous patches
    - can build with egcs
    - a MIF backend written by Kathleen Marszalek and Paul Prescod,
    sponsored by ISOGEN International Corp
    - an enhanced TeX backend written by Kathleen Marszalek, sponsored by
    Novare International, and an associated LaTeX macro package by
    Sebastian Rahtz.
    - configure/autoconf support from Cees de Groot (see
    README.configure); this should make it easier to install; uses libtool 
    for shared libraries
  * apply Cees' autoconf patch 1 from http://www.sgmltools.org/jade.html;
    now we ship libgrove, libspgrove, and libstyle shared libs in the
    libsp1 packages

  * NOTE: shared library SO version numbers have changed.  This version of 
    libsp.so et al are not compatible with the other ones. Number has been 
    moved back from .so.1.3.x to so.1.0.3.  Honestly, I should bump the so 
    to .so.2.x but since the only other pkg which depends on this is
    maintained by me I'm not going to bother.  Feel free to file a bug
    report if this messes you up and I'll look into bumping the .so.
  * debian/rules: use debhelper-style temporary build directories and use
    dh_strip for maximum strip'age
  * config/configure.in: remove sig_atomic_t check, stop adding
    -fno-implicit-templates to CXXFLAGS, add --enable-default-search-path
    for setting the search path
  * debian/rules: stop generating buildinfo file, it's too much of a PITA

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Sep 1998 18:13:27 -0400

jade (1.1.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patches for Jadetex Aug06
      http://tug.org/applications/jadetex/jade.patch.aug06
    This requires jadetex 1.04 or better
  * libsp1*: update README.Debian
  * libsp1-dev: symlink doc dir from libsp1
  * jade maintainer scripts: only blab about removing entries if we really are
  * debian/rules: only install *.htm from jadedoc, eliminating lintian's
    extra-license-file warning
  * debian/rules: minor housekeeping

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Sep 1998 04:09:58 -0400

jade (1.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patches for Jadetex July07
      http://tug.org/applications/jadetex/jade.patch.july07
      http://tug.org/applications/jadetex/jade-newfiles.zip
    This incorporates jadetex table support.  The jadetex 'aug06' patches
    have not been incorporated since this would required jadetex 1.04 or
    better.
  * libsp1.shlibs: provide library in >= 1.3.1-1.1.1-1, rather than
    requiring the exact current version

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Aug 1998 00:02:39 -0400

jade (1.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * libsp1-dev: include libgrove.a and libspgrove.a (no shared versions
    yet, someone tell me if they want them) and some include files for
    grove and spgrove.  Prompted by problems compiling dsc.
  * link /usr/doc/jade/jade.htm to /usr/doc/jade/index.html

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Aug 1998 19:32:41 -0400

jade (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream versions (sp 1.3.1, jade 1.1.1)
  * libsp1 split out from sp, sp-dev renamed to libsp1-dev
  * libsp1-dev depends on libc6-dev and libg++272-dev, and recommends g++272
  * libsp1 replaces older sp's since they had libsp.so.1* in them
  * don't have the link from HTML file to /usr/doc/sp/changelog
  * I tried again to use eg++ instead of g++272 but jade is still
    non-functional when formatting docbook.  For porters, the entire SP
    suite itself seems to do fine under eg++.

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Jul 1998 12:38:08 -0400

jade (1.1-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * jade.1: fixed location reference of jade.htm
  * backout from egcs' c++, since that seems to be the cause of the core
    dumps, so we're back with 'gcc -fno-implicit-templates' as our c++
    compiler; thanks for Terry Dawson <terry@linux.spice.net.au> for
    isolating exactly when jade started crumbling (closes Bug#20796,
    Bug#21895, Bug#21856)
  * set dependancies on libsp.so now that we've got to do this manually
    again
  * rebuild with new sgml-catalog-check.pl from sgml-data, and add a check
    to try to ensure we never build with bad symlinks (closes Bug#21807)
  * add buildinfo.Debian file for all binary packages
  * /usr/doc/sp/README added from upstream, minor updates to reflect
    Debian way
  * debian/control: bumped standards compliance to 2.4.1.0
  * /usr/doc/*/copyright file brought up to policy spec
  * TODO.Debian updated
  * /usr/doc/sp/changelog and /usr/doc/sp-dev/changelog link created
    (policy)

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Sat,  2 May 1998 17:21:06 -0400

jade (1.1-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * set SGML_SEARCH_PATH_DEFAULT to /usr/lib/sgml:/usr/local/lib/sgml (was 
    unset before, leading to wierd searching in /etc sometimes)
  * set SGML_CATALOG_FILES_DEFAULT to
    /usr/lib/sgml/catalog:/usr/local/lib/sgml/catalog
  * rebuild with egcs-2.90.26 980308, remove -fno-implicit-templates,
    which means Alpha platform should compile out of the box, linked
    against libstdc++2.8 as well
  * fixing dependancies:  sp shouldn't depend on itself, sp-dev now
    depends on sync'd version of sp, jade depends on sync'd version of sp; 
    I think tight coupling is there between jade and sp.  I might loosen
    it later.
  * call ldconfig in sp's postinst, as stipulated by David Engel
  * don't build SP tools with -fpic, you silly!

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Mar 1998 16:47:44 -0500

jade (1.1-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * declarations do in /usr/lib/sgml/declaration, not declarations, as per
    SGML subpolicy.
  * unicode subdir moved to /usr/lib/sp/unicode (lintian)
  * added declaration sp_implied.decl, representing sp's default
    declaration
  * don't call 'install-docs -r' from postrm, so scripts changed into
    prerm (lintian)
  * updates to README files

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Mar 1998 21:49:29 -0500

jade (1.1-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * make shared libsp.so.1.3, major revision 1, link all programs in sp
    and jade against that, which lowers the combined size by about 1MB
  * add sp-dev package to hold the unversioned library symlink, the static 
    library, and the include files
  * change documentation area from "text" to "Apps/Text"
  * remove _GNU_SOURCE define, not needed anymore AFAIK
  * move jade DTDs in to dtd subdir, make proper sublinks
  * move jade's dsssl catalog to /usr/lib/jade/catalog
  * rename jade's smgl catalog package from 'dsssl' to 'jade'
  * rename sp's japan.dcl to japan.decl (more standard)
  * include xml.decl

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Mar 1998 15:42:00 -0500

jade (1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * split sp out from this source package, so now the jade source creates
    both the jade and sp packages
  * jade no longer conflicts/replaces/provides sp, but rather depends on
    it
  * sp version is SPVer-JadeSrcVer, i.e., 1.3-1.1-2 (thanks to Yann Dirson)
  * debian/postrm*: be tolerant removing documentation
  * README.Debian: add some links to relevant web sites

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Mar 1998 12:23:11 -0500

jade (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer
  * new upstream version (closes Bug#19155, Bug#19174, Bug#19175)
  * jade now conflicts/replaces/provides sp
  * source managed with CVS
  * updated Standard compliance
  * debian/rules: cleanup and abstraction like I like it, remove debstd
    (closes Bug#15443)
  * debian/control: suggest doc-base, since that is how I register HTML
  * debian/control: switched to priority optional, which was sp's priority
  * define SP_HAVE_SOCKET for http support
  * define _GNU_SOURCE to help Alpha users (closes Bug#14319)
  * include nsgmls, spam, and spent man pages from 1.0.1 distribution
  * rename sx to sgml2xml to prevent namespace pollution

 -- Adam P. Harris <aph@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Mar 1998 04:29:52 -0500

jade (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream release, libc6.
  * debian/postrm: fix cleanup bug (missing $CAT) and use
    install-sgmlcatalog --remove.
  * debian/postinst: *always* remove the old entries, and use
    install-sgmlcatalog --install.  (Plan to ditch all this cleanup code
    before Debian 2.0.)
  * Makefile.jade: turn on SP_HAVE_GETTEXT, but turn of SP_HAVE_SOCKET
    since libc6 has a broken arpa/inet.h that won't build with -ansi.

 -- Mark W. Eichin <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>  Tue, 28 Oct 1997 02:19:39 -0500

jade (0.8-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/postinst, debian/postrm: add _FIX to the $SIG line, and install
    the *dsssl* catalog entries, not the davenport ones (oops,
    overenthusiastic cut and paste...) Make postrm more verbose, let
    postinst treat configure like upgrade. grep $CAT, not stdin.
  * turn off SP_HAVE_GETTEXT until I do a libc6 release.

 -- Mark W. Eichin <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>  Sat, 2 Aug 1997 18:30:58 -0400

jade (0.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Makefile.jade: set SP_HAVE_LOCALE, SP_HAVE_GETTEXT, SP_HAVE_SOCKET as
    well (per suggestions from Ulrich Drepper.)

 -- Mark W. Eichin <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>  Sat, 5 Jul 1997 13:53:27 -0400

jade (0.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Makefile.jade: set SGML_CATALOG_FILES_DEFAULT to the debian value
    (/usr/lib/sgml/catalog, so that the relative names work, *not* the
    /etc/ version.)
  * debian/rules: install dsssl/catalog as dsssl.cat
  * debian/postinst, postrm: use jade-style md5 signatures, more advanced
    cleanup code.

 -- Mark W. Eichin <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>  Tue,  1 Jul 1997 00:54:18 -0400

jade (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release, build with deb-make single.
  * debian/rules: Only build/install jade, leave out the rest because they
    are already in the debian "sp" package.
  * debian/{postinst,postrm}: add/remove DSSSL DTD entries.

 -- Mark W. Eichin <eichin@kitten.gen.ma.us>  Fri, 27 Jun 1997 22:28:34 -0400
