.SH NAME
sgml2xml \- convert SGML to XML
.sp
An SGML System Conforming to
International Standard ISO 8879 \(em
Standard Generalized Markup Language
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsgml2xml\fR [ \fB-Cehilprvx\fR ]  [ \fB-b\fIencoding\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-c\fIcatalog\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-D\fIdir\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-f\fIfile\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-i\fIname\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-w\fIwarning\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-x\fIxml-output-option\fB\fR ]  \fB\fIsysid\fB\fR\fI...\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsgml2xml\fR converts SGML to XML.
\fBsgml2xml\fR parses and validates the SGML document contained in
\fIsysid...\fR and writes an equivalent XML document to the
standard output. \fBsgml2xml\fR will warn about SGML constructs
which have no XML equivalent.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-b\fIencoding\fB\fR
Use \fIencoding\fR for output. 
The default is UTF-8. See \fBnsgmls\fR(1) for the possible encoding types.
.TP
\fB-c\fIcatalog\fB\fR
Use the catalog entry file
\fIfile\fR. 
.TP
\fB-C\fR
The \fIfilename...\fR arguments specify catalog files rather
than the document entity. The document entity is specified by the first
DOCUMENT entry in the catalog files.
.TP
\fB-D\fIdirectory\fB\fR
Search \fIdirectory\fR for files specified in system
identifiers. Multiple \fB-D\fR options are allowed. See \fBnsgmls\fR(1)
for more information about this option.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
Describe open entities in error messages.
.TP
\fB-f\fIfile\fB\fR
Redirect errors to \fIfile\fR. 
This is useful only for shells that do not
support redirection of stderr.
.TP
\fB-i\fIname\fB\fR
Pretend that
<!ENTITY % \fIname\fR "INCLUDE">
occurs at the start of the document type declaration subset in the SGML
document entity. Since repeated definitions of an entity are ignored,
this definition will take precedence over any other definitions of this
entity in the document type declaration. Multiple \fB-i\fR options
are allowed. If the SGML declaration replaces the reserved name
INCLUDE then the new reserved name will be the replacement
text of the entity. Typically the document type declaration will
contain
<!ENTITY % \fIname\fR "IGNORE">
and will use %\fIname\fR;
in the status keyword specification of a
marked section declaration. In this case the effect of the option will
be to cause the marked section not to be ignored.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print the version number.
.TP
\fB-w\fItype\fB\fR
Control warnings and errors according to
\fItype\fR. 
See \fBnsgmls\fR(1) for the allowed values of \fItype\fR.
.TP
\fB-x\fIxml-output-option\fB\fR
Control the XML output, according to the value of
\fIxml_output_option\fR as follows:
.RS
.TP
\fBno-nl-in-tag\fR
Don't use newlines inside start-tags. Usually \fBsgml2xml\fR
uses newlines inside start-tags so as to reduce the probability of
excessively long lines.
.TP
\fBid\fR
Output attribute declarations for ID attributes.
.TP
\fBnotation\fR
Output declarations for notations.
.TP
\fBndata\fR
Output declarations for external data entities. XML requires these
to be NDATA. \fBsgml2xml\fR will warn about CDATA
and SDATA external data entities and output them as NDATA entities.
.TP
\fBcdata\fR
Use XML CDATA sections for CDATA marked sections
and for elements with a declared content of CDATA.
.TP
\fBcomment\fR
Output comment declarations. Comment declarations in the DTD will
not be output.
.TP
\fBlower\fR
Prefer lower case. Names that were subjected to upper-case substitution
by SGML will be folded to lower case. This does not include reserved
names; XML requires these to be in upper-case.
.TP
\fBpi-escape\fR
Escape &<> in the contents of
processing instructions using the amp, lt and
gt entities. This allows processing instructions to
contain the string >?, but requires that applications
handle the escapes.
.TP
\fBempty\fR
Use the <\fIe\fR/> syntax for element
types \fIe\fR declared as EMPTY.
.TP
\fBattlist\fR
Output a ATTLIST declaration for every element
specifying the type of all attributes. The default will always be
#IMPLIED.
.RE
.PP
Multiple \fB-x\fR options are allowed.
