libfile-basedir-perl (0.03-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * New upstream version. Closes: #453073
  * Switched debian/compat to 5.
  * Added a debian/watch file.
  * Added libtest-pod-perl and libtest-pod-coverage-perl to
    Build-Depends-Indep to enable all tests.
  * Added libmodule-build-perl to Build-Depends as it's the new build system.
    We're still using the old MakeMaker compatibility mode until #288806 gets
    fixed by cdbs maintainers.
  * Extend the clean rule to properly remove files left over by the tests.
    Also remove the Makefile because it's left-over non-working without
    the corresponding Build script. That way it's regenerated.
