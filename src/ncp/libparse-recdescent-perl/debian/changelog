libparse-recdescent-perl (1.94.free-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "New" upstream release.  Okay, that is not really true.  I got it
    wrong in my last upload because I tried to add the modified 1.94
    upstream tarball but it existed already in the archive.  Hence the
    funny upstream version number.

libparse-recdescent-perl (1.94-5) unstable; urgency=low

libparse-recdescent-perl (1.94-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Hardcode the dependency on perl to >= 5.8, because
    dh_perl was giving the minimal version 5.6.0-16.  The Text::Balanced
    module, which is included in perl-modules version 5.8 and later, is
    not included in libparse-recdescent-perl anymore, hence the necessity
    of hard-coding the perl dependency (closes: #298298)
  * debian/rules: Do not call dh_perl

    - Removed mention to Text::Balanced module.

    location.
  * debian/rules:  Got right this time the replacements "*.gif"-> "*.png" in

libparse-recdescent-perl (1.90-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control: Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.9.  Changed Section to
    perl, in order to conform to the newly reorganized sections in Debian.
  * In the previous release of this package, Adam Heath
    <doogie@debian.org> has detected a bug in which arguments being passed to
    either implicit or alternations are lost when using the shorthand
    leftop operator syntax('(s /foo/)').  This bug is apparently fixed in
    the present version (closes: #166903).  I am using the test case
    debian/test-arg-alternation.pl and I hope that it is sufficient.  If
    not, this bug report should be reopened.
  * This package includes a newer version of Text::Balanced than that
    provided by perl-modules (closes: #177602).  I agreed with the bug
    reporter that we will leave the situation as it is for now, since this
    package install the module in /usr/share/perl5/, which tooks priority
    in @INC to the place where perl-modules install its version of
    Text::Balanced (/usr/share/perl/5.8.0/).  Thanks to "J.H.M. Dassen
    (Ray)" <fsmla@xinara.org> for the discussions.

      versioned perl to plain perl (closes: #113206).
    - Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.5.6.

    - Removed bashisms like {Parse,Text}/*.pm.  A more robust way of
      finding files under debian/tmp/usr is now used.

      declaration to debian/control.
    - The modules go now to /usr/share/perl5/, intead of /usr/lib/perl5/.

libparse-recdescent-perl (1.80-0.potato.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #74475).  This Debian release works for
    potato (2.2).
  * debian/control:
    - Added Build-Depends field.
    - Since the *.pm in this package call "use 5.005", a dependency on
      perl-5.005 | perl-5.6 is needed, otherwise lintian will complain.
  * debian/rules: Corrected place for demo_*.pl files in the upstream
    tarball.
  * debian/fix-perl-path.pl: Removed file.  The fix for the Perl path in
    the demos is simply done in debian/rules by calling perl with the -p
    and -i options.  Also, put Perl path into demo_Cgrammar.pl.
  * Added tutorial in HTML format and put permission note in
    debian/copyright.  This document is registered through doc-base.  All
    the GIF figures have been converted to the PNG format.  This is why
    the package now Build-Depends on imagemagick.
