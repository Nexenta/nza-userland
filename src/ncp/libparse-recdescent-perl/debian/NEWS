libparse-recdescent-perl (1.94.free-3) unstable; urgency=low

    Realistically, the tutorial from the Perl Journal is not going to be
    in Debian, even in the non-free section.  This tutorial (which was
    included in the Debian package for versions << 1.94.free-1) can be
    read at:

libparse-recdescent-perl (1.94.free-2) unstable; urgency=low

    The tutorial from The Perl Journal, which is shipped with the upstream
    sources, is removed from the package (both source and binary) because
    its licensing terms are not compatible with the DFSG.  A new package
    called libparse-recdescent-perl-tutorial-nonfree containing this
    tutorial has been created.
