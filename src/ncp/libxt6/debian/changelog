libxt (1:1.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Don't export dependencies on libSM and libX11 in the Requires field of
    xt.pc.  They're already in Requires.private, and do more harm than good in
    Requires.  Thanks to Stephen Gran and Margarita Manterola for noticing.
  * Remove Branden from Uploaders with his permission.
  * Don't build-depend on packages with a -1 debian revision.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3.
  * Drop the XS- prefix from Vcs-* control fields.
  * Drop (pre-)dependencies on x11-common from libxt6 and libxt6-dbg, that's
    not needed.
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version}.
  * Remove pre-dependency on x11-common from libxt-dev, that was needed for
    upgrades from sarge.
  * Parse space-separated DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Allow parallel builds.
  * Run autoreconf on build.
  * Remove patch 01_use_extern_C_in_headers.diff, applied upstream.
  * Use --with-xfile-search-path rather than setting XFILESEARCHPATHDEFAULT
    through CFLAGS directly.
  * Stop passing "-include X11/XlibConf.h" in CFLAGS; this was a hack
    introduced in 1:0.99.0+cvs.20050803-1, and unneeded since the upstream fix
    on Sep 24, 2005.
  * Cherry-pick patch from upstream git to link against libICE.

  [ Brice Goglin ]
  * Add a link to www.X.org and a reference to the upstream module
    in the long description.
  * Add upstream URL to debian/copyright.
  * Add README.source, bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3.
  * Use updated xsfbs, closes: #538592.
  * Move -dbg package to section debug.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Drop -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions from LDFLAGS as it conflicts with the Xt
    inheritance mechanism; LP: #343574.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 12 Sep 2005 13:03:25 +1000

    integrated upstream (fix drawing of StripCharts when scaled down).
