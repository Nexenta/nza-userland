patch (2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The patch versions shipped in Debian Etch and Lenny (2.5.9-4 and 2.5.9-5)
  contained two patches that would create reject files in unified format, and
  collect all rejects in a single, "global" reject file. These patches are now
  part of patch 2.6.

  However, the arguments have been renamed:

   * -U or --unified-reject-files  is now  --reject-format=format.
     Additionally, reject files will automatically be in unified format if the
     input patch is in that format.

   * --global-reject-file=file  is now a synonym for  --reject-file=file (-r)
     which has been fixed not to overwrite reject hunks from different files.

  The old syntax is still supported, but will be removed for the Debian
  release following Squeeze.
