    - move pathnames out of rules, into *.install, *.dirs, *.docs, *.examples
    - side effect (but correct): move libsvn_swig_* from libsvn0{,-dev}
      to python2.3-subversion and libsvn-core-perl
    - install Java libraries to /usr/lib/jni, not /usr/lib (Closes: #327789)
  * debian/rules, debian/control: disable libsvn-javahl on arm, armeb,
    mips, mipsel, on advice from Jeroen van Wolffelaar.  It seems kaffe
    may remain broken on these architectures for a while.  (Closes: #329184)
  * debian/rules: rip out "architectures to run full testsuite on" logic,
    on advice from Steve Langasek.  It is not safe to assume that
    debian-specific changes to an upstream release will never cause test
    failures.  Local admins can still use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=notest to
    speed up a local compile.
  * debian/control: relax all versioned build-deps; all the versions are
    satisfied in sarge (and most of them in woody).
  * debian/rules, debian/subversion-tools.{postinst,postrm,install}:
    - move /usr/lib/subversion to /usr/share/subversion (Closes: #330824)
    - move hot-backup.py to /usr/share/doc/subversion/examples
    - create compat symlink /usr/lib/subversion
  * debian/control: remove pkg-subversion-maintainers from Uploaders - it's
    not the right place to document the existence of a list
  * debian/control, debian/rules: build with kaffe-pthreads specifically
    (works around a FTBFS with kaffe 1.1.6)

subversion (1.2.3a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Welcome the Debian Subversion Team (Closes: #322257)
  
  [ Guilherme de S. Pastore ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #320417)
    - tarball repackaged without svnbook, as it's licensed under
      a non-DFSG-free license (Closes: #215083, #218185, #314154)
    - fixes export segmentation fault with versioned items in
      "deleted" state (Closes: #314381, #316133, #316227, #320572, #324037)
  * debian/compat:
    - bump to debhelper compatibility version 4
    - no longer export DH_COMPAT from inside debian/rules
  * debian/control:
    - dropped auto-generation with m4
    - dropped build-dependency on quilt
    - bump to Standards-Version 3.6.2 with no changes
    - removed Conflicts/Replaces on all packages not present in
      stable anymore (Closes: #310519)
  * debian/patches/ltmain.sh.patch:
    - removed; applied upstream
  * debian/patches/kaffe-cast.patch:
    - removed; broken and unnecessary
  * debian/subversion.doc-base.book:
    - removed; the book is no longer present
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Removed; was doing the work of a package description, and
      mentioned the (removed) svnbook
  * debian/python2.3-subversion.README.Debian:
    - Renamed from pythonX.Y-subversion.README.Debian, we longer
      use that auto-generation stuff
  * debian/rules:
    - tiny fixes to unbreak the build process
    - include simple-patchsys.mk from CDBS instead of using quilt;
      it was too complex for our needs
    - fixed detection of tarballs, as to not get confused by CDBS
      auto-generated lists, which would cause the build to fail
    - no longer do any magic to auto-generate debian/control and
      python related documentation; too complex for too little gain
    - set LANG to C, otherwise the build may fail because of tests
      failing for not being able to recognize strings returned by
      some tools
    - no longer do any magic to support builds on pre-sarge
      environments; the package is already complex enough without
      supporting old cruft unnecessarily
  * Removed packaging documentation, as it was pretty much outdated
  * Removed maintenance scripts from the package; left them
    on the 'tools' section of the repository on svn.debian.org

  [ David Kimdon ]
  * Do not install vc-svn.el (closes: #314213, #315100, #324633)
  * Autoload psvn.el by default. (closes: #223303, #235905, #305953)
  * Remove hard-coded DEB_BUILDDIR from debian/rules.
  * Enable javahl bindings by default (closes: #271125, #323839)

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * debian/patches/l10n-segfault.patch:
    - fixes a "svn add" crash in the es, fr, it, pl, pt_BR and zh_TW
      locales (Closes: #316143, #323376, #326079)
  * debian/patches/rpath.patch:
    - port to subversion 1.2.x and reenable (work in progress, suppresses
      most rpaths)
  * debian/lintian-overrides: new file for binary package overrides
  * debian/rules:
    - support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt
    - invent a DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=notest to disable the test suite more
      easily
    - the INSTALL file is redundant, do not install it in /usr/share/doc
    - change #!/usr/bin/env python to #!/usr/bin/python2.3 in assorted
      scripts
    - split and install lintian-overrides to appropriate packages
    - minor cruft removal

subversion (1.1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low
  
  * New upstream release. 
  * Make debian/control.in a double-colon rule.  This allows us to

    cdbs's debian/control rule.
  * Increase debhelper build dependency to 4.1.25 since we use
    dh_python. 
  * Increase version number to prevent this package from being
    removed from experimental.  (1.0.8-1 has been uploaded to 
    unstable.)
  * Disable testsuite on powerpc since I just ran it.

    and the build doesn't fail.

  * Non-maintainer upload with maintainer approval.
  * Reverting the apache2/apr LFS transition by bumping our build-dep
    to (>= 2.0.50-10), as the apache2 maintenance team has decided that
    the ABI transition, while desireable, just wasn't manageable this

    buggery hasn't, well, buggered anything.

  * Only remove modules from apache's configuration when we are
    removing libapache2-svn, not on upgrades. (closes: #251245)
    Additionally, move the module config manipulation from the postrm
    to the prerm.  This way there is no time when apache is configured

subversion (1.0.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix apache modules link in a cleaner way.  Previously I had some
    hard-coded link lines in debian rules.  The present change modfies the
    subversion build system itself to hopefully do the right thing in all
    cases.  This change is less invasive and should allow all archs to

  * Point to /usr/bin/svnshell as an example to help get started using 
    the pythong bindings. (closes: #239924)

  * cvs2svn is no longer part of this package, request for package filed,
    see http://bugs.debian.org/237934 .

  * Apply changes up to the current head of the 1.0.x branch. 
    This line is making its way to become 1.0.1 which is expected

              http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.0.x@8939 
    - Fix directory walk ordering on filesystems that don't return
    '.' first.  (closes: #231364)
    - Many other fixes.
  * Fix description of the subversion book (it is a version control,
    not a revision control system)
  * Remove local copy of patchsys-quilt.mk and add version to quilt build-dep.
  * Don't strip binaries if 'nostrip' is in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Patch from Erno Kuusela to 50vc-svn.el so subversion vc backend doesn't
    supersede an existing default.
  * Don't ship .pyc files in pythonX.Y-subversion.  These files should instead
    be generated in the postinst. (closes: #236170)
  * Detect if debian/control is invalid.  If invalid then recreate it and
    exit failure telling the user to try again.  (closes: #204253)
  * Add debian/shlibs.local which needs to stay around until #231659
    is fixed (closes: #234932).
  * Fix broken stamp files that were among other things making the build
    execute the configure and autogen rules unnecessarily.
  * Update to policy 3.6.1 (no changes).

    - Remove cvs2svn manpage.
  * Fix formatting of NEWS.Debian. (closes: #232940)
  * Put version in shlibs file.  In the last upload I removed all version
    info from the shlibs file rather than converting = to >=.
  * Enable testsuite on many archs.
  * Build with srcdir == builddir.  This fixes some problems in the
    perl bindings and generally makes the build system cleaner.
  * Remove svnadmin-static.  With the build system changes it wasn't 
    easy to keep it and we won't need it for a while if ever.

    within the source package.
  * Fix default repos templates. (closes: #210901)
  * Update swig build-dep to >= 1.3.21.  This isn't actually required
    by Subversion but I have some current Subversion bug reports that
    indicate mixing 1.3.19 builds with 1.3.21 systems may cause problems.
  * Pass fulll path the swig to configure so as to ensure we use the swig
    from the Debian package.
  * Don't pass broken CFLAGS to swig wrapper build (closes: #232591)

  * doc build has changed since the last release, update so it still builds.
  * Add build-conflicts against broken libtool 1.5-6.
  * Don't build book since the source distribution already provides
    us with a built book.
  * Build with Berkeley DB 4.2.
  * Increase required apache2 version to 2.0.48-7 so we build with the
    same version of Berkeley DB.
  * No longer install binaries that include debug symbols.
  * Autogenerated cruft is no longer part of the source package's diff.

subversion (0.33.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (closes: #220672)
    - fix internal diff library (closes: #218406, #220474)
    - cvs2svn fixed (closes: #216868)
  * Change build dependancy from apache2-devb to apache2-threaded-dev.
  * Remove hack to get around broken apr-config now that bug #197685 is
    fixed.
  * Build depend on docbook-xsl rather than docbook-xsl-stylesheets.
    (closes: #220788)
  * Now that neon 0.24.4 is available increase build dependancy to require
    it.  Subversion itself doesn't require the new version but there are
    enough bug fixes in that version of neon that it is better to use it.
  * Enable mod_dav_fs in libapache2-svn.postinst (closes: #219620)
  * Fix propchange-email.pl and commit-access-control.pl interpreter
    (closes: #220692)
  * Corrent python invocation in svnperms.py.
  * Update /etc/subversion/{config,servers}
  * Update debian/copyright. Re-sync with current upstream license (remove
    reference to expat-lite, add reference to apr-util).  Fix download
    URL to point only to http://subversion.tigris.org rather than trying
    to show the exact URL since that can change.

subversion (0.32.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    New manpages. (closes: #206646)
  * The source package shouldn't be in Debian native format. (closes: #216514) 
  * Update default /etc/apache2/mods-available/dav_svn.conf with some better
    comments and bring it up to date with current required syntax.
  * Move last dump/reload notes from NEWS.Debian into README.Debian since it
    isn't news anymore.

subversion (0.31.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove Matt Kraai from Uploaders field. Thanks for all the help 
    Matt! 
  * Wrote debian/tools/svn-make-config.c which is a tool that helps to
    create default config files.  Maybe this can be included upstream
    somehow.  Update /etc/subversion/{config,servers}
  * Include svnadmin-static manpage.

 -- David Kimdon <dwhedon@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 07:03:12 +0200

subversion (0.30.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjust dynamic linker search path and location of svnversion 
    binary so the book build doesn't generate a spurious error message.
    As a bonus the version number in the built doc should be correct
    now instead of saying 'Draft'.
  * Set XSL_DIR when building the docs so we can find things like
    docbook.xsl. It appears as though this succeeded when I built 
    0.30.0-1 because make didn't need to recreate the documentation
    completely.  On the autobuilders this was not the case.

subversion (0.29.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force neon build dependancy and libsvn0-dev dependancy to libneon24.
    In reality neon 0.23.9 or greater will work, but since we need to 
    hard-code the version in the libsvn0-dev dependnacy it is simpler to just
    force libneon24. (closes: #206031)
  * Disable testsuite on archs where it has passed.
  * Remove unneeded, crufty shlibs.local.
  * Make debian/control read-only to discourage edits to it rather than
    debian/control.in. (closes: #211091)
  * Drop debhelper build dependancy back to >=3 so it is easier to 
    build the package on old systems.
  * Actually install NEWS.Debian rather than having it sit in the
    source package where no one can see it. (closes: #210684, #210822)
  * Update /etc/subversion/config and /etc/subversion/servers
  * Make package descriptions more clear and detailed. (closes: #210065)
  * Fix commit-email.pl (closes: #211577)

    about why we are doing the rm.

  * New upstream release :
    - no long includes svn-deisgn info document (closes: #196412)

  * Include HACKING in /usr/share/doc/subversion/. (closes: #191450)
  * Don't automatically load emacs lisp files. The bindings can still be 
    enabled by the system administrator uncommenting the lines in 
    /etc/emacs/site-start.d. (closes: #190804)

  * Remove subversion-server package (closes: #182653).  As indicated 
    in the bug report the subversion-server package was only necessary if
    one wanted to use subversion with apache.  I don't see a compelling
    need for the subversion-server package, all it did is depend on
    subversion, subversion-tools and libapache2-dav-svn.

    some autobuliders.
  * Disable testsuite on the archetectures that passed 0.17.1-1.
  * Remove version information for libapache2-dav-svn dependancy on 
    apache2 since apache2 is a virtual package.

subversion (0.14.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Autotools fixes prompted by a failed autobuild and based on recomendations 
    in /usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/README.Debian.gz
    - call configure with --host and --build flags based on the output of
      dpkg-architecture
    - symlink config.{sub|guess} during build so they are always up to date.
      Add build-dep on autotools-dev.
    - Call autogen.sh when cleaning the tree.  Add versioned build-dep 
      on autoconf.
  * Remove commented python package rule and python2.2-dev build-dep. 
    (I do plan on making the python package like in subversion-snapshot 
    in the future but still need to figure some things out.)

subversion (0.14.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * some build fixes thanks to Jon Middleton <jjm@ixtab.org.uk>
  * libsvn0-dev priority changed from optional to extra since 
    libsvn0-dev depends on extra libdb4.0-dev and policy forbids 
    binary dependancies on packages with lower priorities.
  * libneon build dep changed (libneon-dev -> libneon21-dev)
  * Conform to policy section 12.4 (Editors and Pagers) which states 
    that if the EDITOR variable is not set the program should use 
    /usr/bin/editor when necessary.  (closes: #157129)

subversion (0.14.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix up descriptions to indicate this is no longer pre-alpha,
    this is an alpha realease.
  * remove version dependancy's from build-deps and libapache-dav-svn deps,
    the versions cause more trouble than they are worth and the proper 
    dependancy will be realized (for the most part) by way of libapr.
  * rebuild with new apache2.

    directory (closes: #153262)
  * libsvn -> libsvn0 and other fixes base on recommendations in 
    Junichi Uekawa's Debian Library Packaging guide.

  * New upstream.

  * Build debug version if DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS says to.
  * Include hack to fix broken apxs2, we include our own version of apxs2

    is fixed, that will likely be the release after 2.0.37-2.
  * include selection from INSTALL in README.Debian
  * Make warnings in debian/control about this being in-development, 
    pre-alpha software more conspicuous.
  * Create /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dav_svn.{load|conf} symlinks in
    libapache-dav-svn.postinst if appropriate files exist in 
    /etc/apache2/mods-available.  Delete these links in
    libapache-dav-svn.postrm.
  * include identical README.Debian in subversion and libapache-dav-svn
    the info is pertinant to both packages.
  * write svnadmin manpage
