Fix / work around the bug where 'ssh -o ControlMaster=auto'
interacts badly with the svn+ssh tunnel scheme.  As I note in
the bug log for #413102, I don't really think the problem is
either svn's or openssh's fault, but the obvious way to avoid
it is to avoid accidentally becoming a ControlMaster.  In this
mode we will still use ssh connection sharing, but only if a
ControlMaster is already present.
