Galen Hazelwood <galenh@micron.net> created this package, from sources
found in ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.0.tar.gz.  It
borrows heavily from the original debianization put together by Bruce
Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com> and benifitted considerably from a lot of
help from David Engel <david@elo.ods.com>.  Michael Alan Dorman
<mdorman@debian.org> arranged the beast into its present form, and put
a lot of effort into making ncurses fit with Debian in the best way
possible.  His patches for packaging the ill-fated 4.1 release form the
backbone of this version.  The current maintainer is greatly in debt to
his illustrious predecessors.

During Galen's absence, Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>, James Troup
jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk> and J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
worked on ncurses, resulting in the 1.9.9g-8.8 version that got included in
Debian 2.0.

Ray took the new upstream 4.2 sources and re-did most of the packaging using
the current Debian tools.  I (Galen) finally rejoined the debian world at
this point and used ray's work for the new ncurses 4.2 packages. (Thanks
for picking up the slack for me, guys.  I owe you some beers.)
