Note for experienced users
--------------------------

The Latin Modern fonts can be used as a substitution for CM, CS, PL, and VN as
mentioned in the README file. Several map files and encoding files (the ones
with '-rep-' in their name) have been prepared for this purpose and can be
found in <TEXMFMAIN>/fonts/map/dvips/lm and <TEXMFMAIN>/fonts/enc/dvips/lm.

To make use of these map files, you should place the appropriate .cfg file(s)
from this directory into /etc/texmf/updmap.d/. Don't forget to run
update-updmap, mktexlsr and updmap-sys afterwards.
