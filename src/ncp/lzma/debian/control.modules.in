Description: Source of the lzma kernel module
 LZMA is a compression algorithm, based on the famous Lempel Ziv
 compression method.
 .
 The main characteristics of the algorithm are very good compression,
 fast decompression, use of lot of RAM for compression and low usage of
 RAM for decompression.
 .
 LZMA provides high compression ratio and very fast decompression, so it
 is very suitable for embedded applications. For example, it can be used
 for ROM (firmware) compression.
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel module for _KVERS_
