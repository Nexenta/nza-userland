# We had to use cc as the linker (see CONFIGURE_OPTIONS above) so the

# must pass the -m64 flag through cc to the linker when building 64 bit 
# libraries.  We can't just add it to LDFLAGS because then it gets used 
# when creating executables and static libs and generates lots of noise 
# in the build logs.  LDARCHFLAG is only recognized by the Makefile in
