Upgrade appliance software and/or install new software components and modules.

  IMPORTANT
  =========
  It is important to perform appliance upgrade operation via provided
  interface and under administrative control of Nexenta management
  software.

  LOCAL UPGRADE OPTIONS
  =====================
  You can use Nexenta Management Console to upgrade appliance
  software from the local media (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM).
  To do this automatically, use the -c flag.
  To do this manually:

  1) Insert CD/DVD-ROM that contains appliance's APT repository
     and identify the corresponding mountpoint:

     $prompt show lun cdrom -v

  2) Edit APT configuration via:

     $prompt setup appliance repository

     When in the Editor, comment out (using '\#') all existing lines
     and add the following line:

     deb file://[MOUNTPOINT] [DIST]-stable main contrib non-free

     for example:

     deb file:///media/Elatte_UpgradeCD elatte-stable main contrib non-free

Examples:
1) Dry-run appliance upgrade, produce detailed (verbose) output:
   $prompt setup appliance upgrade -t -v

2) Upgrade the appliance non-interactively (assume Yes to all questions)
   $prompt setup appliance upgrade -y

3) Upgrade only appliance management sub-systems: NMS, NMC, and NMV components
   $prompt setup appliance upgrade nms nmc nmv

                      SYSTEM NOTICE

     The first phase of upgrade has completed successfully:
       - created Upgrade Checkpoint '$rootfs_nosyspool'
       - the appliance is ready to reboot into this new checkpoint

   +------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                                  |
   |  At this point there are two options:                            |
   |                                                                  |
   |   - You can reboot now and make sure that system is healthy.     |
   |     You will be prompted to activate the newly created           |
   |     checkpoint after the reboot.                                 |
   |                                                                  |
   |   - Or, you can simply continue using the appliance as is and    |
   |     later activate this new checkpoint, and then reboot.         |
   |                                                                  |
