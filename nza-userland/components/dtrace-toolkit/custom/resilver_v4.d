/* Description: This script will show progress of any active resilvers
 * happening on the system. It has been tested and sanity-checked on mirror
 * and raidz1 vdevs, but since we are tracing deep within zio, should hold
 * true for all other types. Note: It displays I/O in terms of read operations
 * on the drives that we're resilvering *from*, in order to reflect read
 * inflation for raidzN vdevs, where in order to reconstruct a block we have
 * to read from all other devices in the same vdev.
