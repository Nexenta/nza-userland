Subject: kqueue set_watched_dirs: fix termination condition

num_fds is the number of elements of dirs currently in use. This bug
meant that encountering a previously un-watched directory would cause j
to increment forever, and so dirs[j] would eventually segfault.

(I've checked the corresponding code for inotify, and it's correct. I
wonder if some of the duplication could be eliminated.)

Thanks to Pablo Mart√≠ Gamboa <pmarti@warp.es> for reporting this issue!
