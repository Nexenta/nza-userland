# This is a list of SMF services which should be disabled when installing
# a zone from an image of a physical system (that is, only when installing
# with the zoneadm -d or -a option).  Do not edit this file.  Site-specific
# services which must be disabled should be listed in the
# /etc/brand/native/smf_disable.conf file.  During the zone installation, the
# services will be disabled if they existed on the original physical system.
