Nexenta vdbench characterization scripts for file systems and raw disks

Run procedure:

1. become root in bash shell

2. cd /opt/vdbench/nexenta

For disks:
The run_4k_disk_char script runs a full-stroke random read and write workload on the device.
	./run_4k_disk_char c#t#d#

For file systems:
The run_zfs_fs_4k_char script runs a random read and write workload on a file system.
	./run_zfs_fs_4k_char /volumes/mypool/myfolder

To run the SNIA Solid State Storage Performance Test Specification for Enterprise disks:
	./run_sss_pts_disk c#t#d#
	or
	./run_sss_pts_disk /dev/zvol/rdsk/poolname/zvolname

In both cases, the vdbench output and other pertinent data is rolled into a timestamped tarball
in the current directory.
